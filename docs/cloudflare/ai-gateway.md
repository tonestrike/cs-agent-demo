Understanding your application's performance is essential for optimization. Developers often have different priorities, and finding the optimal solution involves balancing key factors such as cost, latency, and accuracy. Some prioritize low-latency responses, while others focus on accuracy or cost-efficiency.

AI Gateway's Evaluations provide the data needed to make informed decisions on how to optimize your AI application. Whether it is adjusting the model, provider, or prompt, this feature delivers insights into key metrics around performance, speed, and cost. It empowers developers to better understand their application's behavior, ensuring improved accuracy, reliability, and customer satisfaction.

Evaluations use datasets which are collections of logs stored for analysis. You can create datasets by applying filters in the Logs tab, which help narrow down specific logs for evaluation.

Our first step toward comprehensive AI evaluations starts with human feedback (currently in open beta). We will continue to build and expand AI Gateway with additional evaluators.

     * `AI Gateway - Read`
     * `AI Gateway - Edit`

  2. Get your [Account ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/).

  3. Using that API token and Account ID, send a [`POST` request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai_gateway/methods/create/) to the Cloudflare API.

### Authenticated gateway 🔒

When you enable authentication on gateway each request is required to include a valid Cloudflare API token, adding an extra layer of security. We recommend using an authenticated gateway to prevent unauthorized access. [Learn more](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/authentication/).

## Provider Authentication

Authenticate with your upstream AI provider using one of the following options:

* **Unified Billing:** Use the AI Gateway billing to pay for and authenticate your inference requests. Refer to [Unified Billing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/unified-billing/).
* **BYOK (Store Keys):** Store your own provider API Keys with Cloudflare, and AI Gateway will include them at runtime. Refer to [BYOK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/bring-your-own-keys/).
* **Request headers:** Include your provider API Key in the request headers as you normally would (for example, `Authorization: Bearer <OPENAI_API_KEY>`).

## Integration Options

### Unified API Endpoint

OpenAI Compatible Recommended

The easiest way to get started with AI Gateway is through our OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint. This allows you to use existing OpenAI SDKs and tools with minimal code changes while gaining access to multiple AI providers.

`https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_name}/compat/chat/completions`

**Key benefits:**

* Drop-in replacement for OpenAI API, works with existing OpenAI SDKs and other OpenAI compliant clients
* Switch between providers by changing the `model` parameter
* Dynamic Routing - Define complex routing scenarios requiring conditional logic, conduct A/B tests, set rate / budget limits, etc

#### Example:

Make a request to

AI Gateway supports a variety of headers to help you configure, customize, and manage your API requests. This page provides a complete list of all supported headers, along with a short description

| Term | Definition |
| - | - |
| cf-aig-backoff | Header to customize the backoff type for [request retries](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling/#request-retries) of a request. |
| cf-aig-cache-key | The [cf-aig-cache-key-aig-cache-key](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching/#custom-cache-key-cf-aig-cache-key) let you override the default cache key in order to precisely set the cacheability setting for any resource. |
| cf-aig-cache-status | [Status indicator for caching](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching/#default-configuration), showing if a request was served from cache. |
| cf-aig-cache-ttl | Specifies the [cache time-to-live for responses](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching/#cache-ttl-cf-aig-cache-ttl). |
| cf-aig-collect-log | The [cf-aig-collect-log](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/logging/#collect-logs-cf-aig-collect-log) header allows you to bypass the default log setting for the gateway. |
| cf-aig-custom-cost | Allows the [customization of request cost](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/custom-costs/#custom-cost) to reflect user-defined parameters. |
| cf-aig-event-id | [cf-aig-event-id](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/evaluations/add-human-feedback-api/#3-retrieve-the-cf-aig-log-id) is a unique identifier for an event, used to trace specific events through the system. |
| cf-aig-log-id | The [cf-aig-log-id](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/evaluations/add-human-feedback-api/#3-retrieve-the-cf-aig-log-id) is a unique identifier for the specific log entry to which you want to add feedback. |
| cf-aig-max-attempts | Header to customize the number of max attempts for [request retries](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling/#request-retries) of a request. |
| cf-aig-metadata | [Custom metadata](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/custom-metadata/)allows you to tag requests with user IDs or other identifiers, enabling better tracking and analysis of your requests. |

| cf-aig-retry-delay | Header to customize the retry delay for [request retries](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling/#request-retries) of a request. |
| cf-aig-skip-cache | Header to [bypass caching for a specific request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching/#skip-cache-cf-aig-skip-cache). |
| cf-aig-step | [cf-aig-step](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/fallbacks/#response-headercf-aig-step) identifies the processing step in the AI Gateway flow for better tracking and debugging. |
| cf-cache-ttl | Deprecated: This header is replaced by `cf-aig-cache-ttl`. It specifies cache time-to-live. |
| cf-skip-cache | Deprecated: This header is replaced by `cf-aig-skip-cache`. It bypasses caching for a specific request. |

## Configuration hierarchy

Settings in AI Gateway can be configured at three levels: **Provider**, **Request**, and **Gateway**. Since the same settings can be configured in multiple locations, the following hierarchy determines which value is applied:

1. **Provider-level headers**: Relevant only when using the [Universal Endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/universal/), these headers take precedence over all other configurations.
2. **Request-level headers**: Apply if no provider-level headers are set.
3. **Gateway-level settings**: Act as the default if no headers are set at the provider or request levels.

This hierarchy ensures consistent behavior, prioritizing the most specific configurations. Use provider-level and request-level headers for more fine-tuned control, and gateway settings for general defaults.

title: Authenticated Gateway · Cloudflare AI Gateway docs
description: Add security by requiring a valid authorization token for each request.
lastUpdated: 2025-10-07T18:26:33.000Z
chatbotDeprioritize: false
source_url:
  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/authentication/
  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/authentication/index.md
---

Using an Authenticated Gateway in AI Gateway adds security by requiring a valid authorization token for each request. This feature is especially useful when storing logs, as it prevents unauthorized access and protects against invalid requests that can inflate log storage usage and make it harder to find the data you need. With Authenticated Gateway enabled, only requests with the correct token are processed.

Note

We recommend enabling Authenticated Gateway when opting to store logs with AI Gateway.

If Authenticated Gateway is enabled but a request does not include the required `cf-aig-authorization` header, the request will fail. This setting ensures that only verified requests pass through the gateway. To bypass the need for the `cf-aig-authorization` header, make sure to disable Authenticated Gateway.

## Setting up Authenticated Gateway using the Dashboard

1. Go to the Settings for the specific gateway you want to enable authentication for.
2. Select **Create authentication token** to generate a custom token with the required `Run` permissions. Be sure to securely save this token, as it will not be displayed again.
3. Include the `cf-aig-authorization` header with your API token in each request for this gateway.
4. Return to the settings page and toggle on Authenticated Gateway.

## Example requests with OpenAI

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai/chat/completions \
  --header 'cf-aig-authorization: Bearer {CF_AIG_TOKEN}' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer OPENAI_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"model": "gpt-5-mini", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is Cloudflare?"}]}'
```

Using the OpenAI SDK:

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";


const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/account-id/gateway/openai",
  defaultHeaders: {
    "cf-aig-authorization": `Bearer {token}`,
  },
});
```

## Example requests with the Vercel AI SDK

```javascript
import { createOpenAI } from "@ai-sdk/openai";


const openai = createOpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/account-id/gateway/openai",
  headers: {
    "cf-aig-authorization": `Bearer {token}`,
  },
});
```

## Expected behavior

Note

When an AI Gateway is accessed from a Cloudflare Worker using a **binding**, the `cf-aig-authorization` header does not need to be manually included.\
Requests made through bindings are **pre-authenticated** within the associated Cloudflare account.

The following table outlines gateway behavior based on the authentication settings and header status:

| Authentication Setting | Header Info | Gateway State | Response |
| - | - | - | - |
| On | Header present | Authenticated gateway | Request succeeds |
| On | No header | Error | Request fails due to missing authorization |
| Off | Header present | Unauthenticated gateway | Request succeeds |
| Off | No header | Unauthenticated gateway | Request succeeds |

  Cloudflare dashboard. Instead of including API keys in every request to your

  your gateway configuration.

  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/bring-your-own-keys/index.md
---

## Introduction

Bring your own keys (BYOK) is a feature in Cloudflare AI Gateway that allows you to securely store your AI provider API keys directly in the Cloudflare dashboard. Instead of including API keys in every request to your AI models, you can configure them once in the dashboard, and reference them in your gateway configuration.

The keys are stored securely with [Secrets Store](https://developers.cloudflare.com/secrets-store/) and allows for:

* Secure storage and limit exposure
* Easier key rotation
* Rate limit, budget limit and other restrictions with [Dynamic Routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/dynamic-routing/)

## Setting up BYOK

### Prerequisites

* Ensure your gateway is [authenticated](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/authentication/).
* Ensure you have appropriate [permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/secrets-store/access-control/) to create and deploy secrets on Secrets Store.

### Configure API keys

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **AI** > **AI Gateway**.
3. Select your gateway or create a new one.
4. Go to the **Provider Keys** section.
5. Click **Add API Key**.
6. Select your AI provider from the dropdown.
7. Enter your API key and optionally provide a description.
8. Click **Save**.

### Update your applications

Once you've configured your API keys in the dashboard:

1. **Remove API keys from your code**: Delete any hardcoded API keys or environment variables.
2. **Update request headers**: Remove provider authorization headers from your requests. Note that you still need to pass `cf-aig-authorization`.
3. **Test your integration**: Verify that requests work without including API keys.

## Example

With BYOK enabled, your workflow changes from:

1. **Traditional approach**: Include API key in every request header

   ```bash
   curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai/chat/completions \
     -H 'cf-aig-authorization: Bearer {CF_AIG_TOKEN}' \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model": "gpt-4", "messages": [...]}'
   ```

2. **BYOK approach**: Configure key once in dashboard, make requests without exposing keys

   ```bash
   curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai/chat/completions \
     -H 'cf-aig-authorization: Bearer {CF_AIG_TOKEN}' \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model": "gpt-4", "messages": [...]}'
   ```

## Managing API keys

### Viewing configured keys

In the AI Gateway dashboard, you can:

* View all configured API keys by provider
* See when each key was last used
* Check the status of each key (active, expired, invalid)

### Rotating keys

To rotate an API key:

1. Generate a new API key from your AI provider
2. In the Cloudflare dashboard, edit the existing key entry
3. Replace the old key with the new one
4. Save the changes

Your applications will immediately start using the new key without any code changes or downtime.

### Revoking access

To remove an API key:

1. In the AI Gateway dashboard, find the key you want to remove
2. Click the **Delete** button
3. Confirm the deletion

Impact of key deletion

Deleting an API key will immediately stop all requests that depend on it. Make sure to update your applications or configure alternative keys before deletion.

## Multiple keys per provider

AI Gateway supports storing multiple API keys for the same provider. This allows you to:

* Use different keys for different use cases (for example, development vs production)
* Gradually migrate between keys during rotation

### Key aliases

Each API key can be assigned an alias to identify it. When you add a key, you can specify a custom alias, or the system will use `default` as the alias.

When making requests, AI Gateway uses the key with the `default` alias by default. To use a different key, include the `cf-aig-byok-alias` header with the alias of the key you want to use.

### Example: Using a specific key alias

If you have multiple OpenAI keys configured with different aliases (for example, `default`, `production`, and `testing`), you can specify which one to use:

```bash
# Uses the key with alias "default" (no header needed)
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai/chat/completions \
  -H 'cf-aig-authorization: Bearer {CF_AIG_TOKEN}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-4", "messages": [...]}'
```

```bash
# Uses the key with alias "production"
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai/chat/completions \
  -H 'cf-aig-authorization: Bearer {CF_AIG_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'cf-aig-byok-alias: production' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-4", "messages": [...]}'
```

```bash
# Uses the key with alias "testing"
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai/chat/completions \
  -H 'cf-aig-authorization: Bearer {CF_AIG_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'cf-aig-byok-alias: testing' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-4", "messages": [...]}'
```

---

AI Gateway allows you to set custom costs at the request level. By using this feature, the cost metrics can accurately reflect your unique pricing, overriding the default or public model costs.

Note

Custom costs will only apply to requests that pass tokens in their response. Requests without token information will not have costs calculated.

## Custom cost

To add custom costs to your API requests, use the `cf-aig-custom-cost` header. This header enables you to specify the cost per token for both input (tokens sent) and output (tokens received).

* **per\_token\_in**: The negotiated input token cost (per token).
* **per\_token\_out**: The negotiated output token cost (per token).

There is no limit to the number of decimal places you can include, ensuring precise cost calculations, regardless of how small the values are.

Custom costs will appear in the logs with an underline, making it easy to identify when custom pricing has been applied.

In this example, if you have a negotiated price of $1 per million input tokens and $2 per million output tokens, include the `cf-aig-custom-cost` header as shown below.

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai/chat/completions \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'cf-aig-custom-cost: {"per_token_in":0.000001,"per_token_out":0.000002}' \
  --data ' {
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "When is Cloudflare’s Birthday Week?"
          }
        ]
      }'
```

Note

If a response is served from cache (cache hit), the cost is always `0`, even if you specified a custom cost. Custom costs only apply when the request reaches the model provider.

## Overview

Custom Providers allow you to integrate AI providers that are not natively supported by AI Gateway. This feature enables you to use AI Gateway's observability, caching, rate limiting, and other features with any AI provider that has an HTTPS API endpoint.

## Use cases

* **Internal AI models**: Connect to your organization's self-hosted AI models
* **Regional providers**: Integrate with AI providers specific to your region
* **Specialized models**: Use domain-specific AI services not available through standard providers
* **Custom endpoints**: Route requests to your own AI infrastructure

## Before you begin

### Prerequisites

* An active Cloudflare account with AI Gateway access
* A valid API key from your custom AI provider
* The HTTPS base URL for your provider's API

### Authentication

The API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, or deleting custom providers require authentication. You need to create a Cloudflare API token with the appropriate permissions.

To create an API token:

1. Go to the [Cloudflare dashboard API tokens page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=:account/api-tokens)
2. Click **Create Token**
3. Select **Custom Token** and add the following permissions:
   * `AI Gateway - Edit`
4. Click **Continue to summary** and then **Create Token**
5. Copy the token - you'll use it in the `Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` header

## Create a custom provider

* API

  To create a new custom provider using the API:

  1. Get your [Account ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/) and Account Tag.

  2. Send a `POST` request to create a new custom provider:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/ai-gateway/custom-providers" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "name": "My Custom Provider",
      "slug": "some-provider",
      "base_url": "https://api.myprovider.com",
      "description": "Custom AI provider for internal models",
      "enable": true
    }'
  ```

  **Required fields:**

  * `name` (string): Display name for your provider
  * `slug` (string): Unique identifier (alphanumeric with hyphens). Must be unique within your account.
  * `base_url` (string): HTTPS URL for your provider's API endpoint. Must start with `https://`.

    -d '{"enable": true}'
  ```

  Update provider URL:

  ```bash
  curl -X PATCH "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/ai-gateway/custom-providers/{provider_id}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"base_url": "https://api.newprovider.com"}'
  ```

  Cache invalidation

  Updates to custom providers automatically invalidate any cached entries related to that provider.

* Dashboard

  To update an existing custom provider:

  1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
  2. Go to [**Compute & AI** > **AI Gateway** > **Custom Providers**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-gateway/custom-providers).
  3. Find the custom provider you want to update and select **Edit**.
  4. Update the fields you want to change (name, slug, base URL, etc.).
  5. Select **Save** to apply your changes.

## Delete a custom provider

* API

  Delete a custom provider:

  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/ai-gateway/custom-providers/{provider_id}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"
  ```

  **Response:**

  ```json
  {
    "success": true,

      "name": "My Custom Provider",
      "slug": "some-provider"
    }
  }
  ```

  Impact of deletion

  Deleting a custom provider will immediately stop all requests routed through it. Ensure you have updated your applications before deleting a provider. Cache entries related to the provider will also be invalidated.

* Dashboard

  To delete a custom provider:

  1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
  2. Go to [**Compute & AI** > **AI Gateway** > **Custom Providers**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-gateway/custom-providers).
  3. Find the custom provider you want to delete and select **Delete**.
  4. Confirm the deletion when prompted.

  Impact of deletion

  Deleting a custom provider will immediately stop all requests routed through it. Ensure you have updated your applications before deleting a provider.

## Using custom providers with AI Gateway

Once you've created a custom provider, you can route requests through AI Gateway. When referencing your custom provider, you must prefix the slug with `custom-`.

Custom provider prefix

All custom provider slugs must be prefixed with `custom-` when making requests through AI Gateway. For example, if your provider slug is `some-provider`, you must use `custom-some-provider` in your requests.

### Via Unified API

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/compat/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROVIDER_API_KEY" \
  -H "cf-aig-authorization: Bearer $CF_AIG_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "custom-some-provider/model-name",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

In the Unified API, specify the model using the format: `custom-{slug}/{model-name}`

### Via provider-specific endpoint

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/custom-some-provider/your-endpoint \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROVIDER_API_KEY" \
  -H "cf-aig-authorization: Bearer $CF_AIG_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "your": "request payload"
  }'
```

The request will be proxied to: `https://api.myprovider.com/your-endpoint`

**Path structure:** `/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/custom-{slug}/{provider-path}`

## Common errors

### 409 Conflict - Duplicate slug

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 1003,
      "message": "A custom provider with this slug already exists",
      "path": ["body", "slug"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Each custom provider slug must be unique within your account. Choose a different slug or update the existing provider.

### 404 Not Found

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 1004,
      "message": "Custom Provider not found"
    }
  ]
}
```

The specified provider ID does not exist or you don't have access to it. Verify the provider ID and your authentication credentials.

### 400 Bad Request - Invalid base\_url

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 1002,
      "message": "base_url must be a valid HTTPS URL starting with https://",
      "path": ["body", "base_url"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The `base_url` field must be a valid HTTPS URL. HTTP URLs are not supported for security reasons.

## Best practices

1. **Use descriptive slugs**: Choose slugs that clearly identify the provider (e.g., `internal-gpt`, `regional-ai`)
2. **Document your integrations**: Use the `curl_example` and `js_example` fields to provide usage examples
3. **Enable gradually**: Test with `enable: false` before making the provider active
4. **Monitor usage**: Use AI Gateway's analytics to track requests to your custom providers
5. **Secure your endpoints**: Ensure your custom provider's base URL implements proper authentication and authorization
6. **Use BYOK**: Store provider API keys securely using [BYOK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/bring-your-own-keys/) instead of including them in every request

## Limitations

* Custom providers are account-specific and not shared across Cloudflare accounts
* The `base_url` must use HTTPS (HTTP is not supported)
* Provider slugs must be unique within each account
* Cache and rate limiting settings apply globally to the provider, not per-model

title: Fallbacks · Cloudflare AI Gateway docs
description: Specify model or provider fallbacks with your Universal endpoint to
  handle request failures and ensure reliability.
lastUpdated: 2025-08-20T18:25:25.000Z
chatbotDeprioritize: true
source_url:
  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/fallbacks/
  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/fallbacks/index.md
---

Specify model or provider fallbacks with your [Universal endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/universal/) to handle request failures and ensure reliability.

Cloudflare can trigger your fallback provider in response to [request errors](#request-failures) or [predetermined request timeouts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling#request-timeouts). The [response header `cf-aig-step`](#response-headercf-aig-step) indicates which step successfully processed the request.

## Request failures

By default, Cloudflare triggers your fallback if a model request returns an error.

### Example

In the following example, a request first goes to the [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) Inference API. If the request fails, it falls back to OpenAI. The response header `cf-aig-step` indicates which provider successfully processed the request.

1. Sends a request to Workers AI Inference API.
2. If that request fails, proceeds to OpenAI.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[AI Gateway] --> B[Request to Workers AI Inference API]
    B -->|Success| C[Return Response]
    B -->|Failure| D[Request to OpenAI API]
    D --> E[Return Response]
```



You can add as many fallbacks as you need, just by adding another object in the array.

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id} \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
  {
    "provider": "workers-ai",
    "endpoint": "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer {cloudflare_token}",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "query": {
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "You are a friendly assistant"
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "provider": "openai",
    "endpoint": "chat/completions",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer {open_ai_token}",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "query": {
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "stream": true,
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]'
```

## Response header(cf-aig-step)

When using the [Universal endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/universal/) with fallbacks, the response header `cf-aig-step` indicates which model successfully processed the request by returning the step number. This header provides visibility into whether a fallback was triggered and which model ultimately processed the response.

* `cf-aig-step:0` – The first (primary) model was used successfully.
* `cf-aig-step:1` – The request fell back to the second model.
* `cf-aig-step:2` – The request fell back to the third model.
* Subsequent steps – Each fallback increments the step number by 1.

Deprecated

While the request handling features described on this page still work, [Dynamic Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/dynamic-routing/) is now the preferred way to achieve advanced request handling, including timeouts, retries, and fallbacks. Dynamic Routing provides a more powerful and flexible approach with a visual interface for managing complex routing scenarios.

Your AI gateway supports different strategies for handling requests to providers, which allows you to manage AI interactions effectively and ensure your applications remain responsive and reliable.

## Request timeouts

A request timeout allows you to trigger fallbacks or a retry if a provider takes too long to respond.

These timeouts help:

* Improve user experience, by preventing users from waiting too long for a response
* Proactively handle errors, by detecting unresponsive providers and triggering a fallback option

Request timeouts can be set on a Universal Endpoint or directly on a request to any provider.

### Definitions

A timeout is set in milliseconds. Additionally, the timeout is based on when the first part of the response comes back. As long as the first part of the response returns within the specified timeframe - such as when streaming a response - your gateway will wait for the response.

### Configuration

#### Universal Endpoint

If set on a [Universal Endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/universal/), a request timeout specifies the timeout duration for requests and triggers a fallback.

For a Universal Endpoint, configure the timeout value by setting a `requestTimeout` property within the provider-specific `config` object. Each provider can have a different `requestTimeout` value for granular customization.

```bash
curl 'https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
    {

        "config": {
            "requestTimeout": 3000
        },
    }
]'
```

#### Direct provider

If set on a [provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/) request, request timeout specifies the timeout duration for a request and - if exceeded - returns an error.

For a provider-specific endpoint, configure the timeout value by adding a `cf-aig-request-timeout` header.

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/workers-ai/@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
 --header 'Authorization: Bearer {cf_api_token}' \
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --header 'cf-aig-request-timeout: 5000'
 --data '{"prompt": "What is Cloudflare?"}'
```

***

## Request retries

AI Gateway also supports automatic retries for failed requests, with a maximum of five retry attempts.

This feature improves your application's resiliency, ensuring you can recover from temporary issues without manual intervention.

Request timeouts can be set on a Universal Endpoint or directly on a request to any provider.

### Definitions

With request retries, you can adjust a combination of three properties:

* Number of attempts (maximum of 5 tries)
* How long before retrying (in milliseconds, maximum of 5 seconds)
* Backoff method (constant, linear, or exponential)

On the final retry attempt, your gateway will wait until the request completes, regardless of how long it takes.

### Configuration

#### Universal endpoint

If set on a [Universal Endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/universal/), a request retry will automatically retry failed requests up to five times before triggering any configured fallbacks.

For a Universal Endpoint, configure the retry settings with the following properties in the provider-specific `config`:

```json
config:{
  maxAttempts?: number;
  retryDelay?: number;
  backoff?: "constant" | "linear" | "exponential";
}
```

As with the [request timeout](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling/#universal-endpoint), each provider can have a different retry settings for granular customization.

```bash
curl 'https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
    {
        "provider": "workers-ai",
        "endpoint": "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
        "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer {cloudflare_token}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        "config": {
            "maxAttempts": 2,
            "retryDelay": 1000,
            "backoff": "constant"
        },
39 collapsed lines
        "query": {
            "messages": [
                {

                    "content": "You are a friendly assistant"
                },
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    {
        "provider": "workers-ai",
        "endpoint": "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-fast",
        "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer {cloudflare_token}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        "query": {
            "messages": [
                {

                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
                }
            ]
        },
        "config": {
            "maxAttempts": 4,
            "retryDelay": 1000,
            "backoff": "exponential"
        },
    }
]'
```

#### Direct provider

If set on a [provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/universal/) request, a request retry will automatically retry failed requests up to five times. On the final retry attempt, your gateway will wait until the request completes, regardless of how long it takes.

For a provider-specific endpoint, configure the retry settings by adding different header values:

* `cf-aig-max-attempts` (number)
* `cf-aig-retry-delay` (number)
* `cf-aig-backoff` ("constant" | "linear" | "exponential)

Human feedback is a valuable metric to assess the performance of your AI models. By incorporating human feedback, you can gain deeper insights into how the model's responses are perceived and how well it performs from a user-centric perspective. This feedback can then be used in evaluations to calculate performance metrics, driving optimization and ultimately enhancing the reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of your AI application.

Human feedback measures the performance of your dataset based on direct human input. The metric is calculated as the percentage of positive feedback (thumbs up) given on logs, which are annotated in the Logs tab of the Cloudflare dashboard. This feedback helps refine model performance by considering real-world evaluations of its output.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of adding human feedback to your evaluations in AI Gateway using the Cloudflare dashboard.

On the next guide, you can [learn how to add human feedback via the API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/evaluations/add-human-feedback-api/).

## 1. Log in to the dashboard

In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **AI Gateway** page.

[Go to **AI Gateway**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-gateway)

## 2. Access the Logs tab

1. Go to **Logs**.

2. The Logs tab displays all logs associated with your datasets. These logs show key information, including:

   * Timestamp: When the interaction occurred.
   * Status: Whether the request was successful, cached, or failed.
   * Model: The model used in the request.
   * Tokens: The number of tokens consumed by the response.
   * Cost: The cost based on token usage.
   * Duration: The time taken to complete the response.
   * Feedback: Where you can provide human feedback on each log.

## 3. Provide human feedback

1. Click on the log entry you want to review. This expands the log, allowing you to see more detailed information.

2. In the expanded log, you can view additional details such as:

   * The user prompt.
   * The model response.
   * HTTP response details.
   * Endpoint information.

3. You will see two icons:

   * Thumbs up: Indicates positive feedback.
   * Thumbs down: Indicates negative feedback.

4. Click either the thumbs up or thumbs down icon based on how you rate the model response for that particular log entry.

## 4. Evaluate human feedback

After providing feedback on your logs, it becomes a part of the evaluation process.

When you run an evaluation (as outlined in the [Set Up Evaluations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/evaluations/set-up-evaluations/) guide), the human feedback metric will be calculated based on the percentage of logs that received thumbs-up feedback.

Note

You need to select human feedback as an evaluator to receive its metrics.

## 5. Review results

After running the evaluation, review the results on the Evaluations tab. You will be able to see the performance of the model based on cost, speed, and now human feedback, represented as the percentage of positive feedback (thumbs up).

The human feedback score is displayed as a percentage, showing the distribution of positively rated responses from the database.

For more information on running evaluations, refer to the documentation [Set Up Evaluations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/evaluations/set-up-evaluations/).

  to an AI Gateway request using the Cloudflare API. You will learn how to
  retrieve the relevant request logs, and submit feedback using the API.

---

This guide will walk you through the steps of adding human feedback to an AI Gateway request using the Cloudflare API. You will learn how to retrieve the relevant request logs, and submit feedback using the API.

If you prefer to add human feedback via the dashboard, refer to [Add Human Feedback](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/evaluations/add-human-feedback/).

## 1. Create an API Token

1. [Create an API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with the following permissions:

* `AI Gateway - Read`
* `AI Gateway - Edit`

1. Get your [Account ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/).
2. Using that API token and Account ID, send a [`POST` request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai_gateway/methods/create/) to the Cloudflare API.

## 2. Retrieve the `cf-aig-log-id`

The `cf-aig-log-id` is a unique identifier for the specific log entry to which you want to add feedback. Below are two methods to obtain this identifier.

### Method 1: Locate the `cf-aig-log-id` in the request response

This method allows you to directly find the `cf-aig-log-id` within the header of the response returned by the AI Gateway. This is the most straightforward approach if you have access to the original API response.

The steps below outline how to do this.

1. **Make a Request to the AI Gateway**: This could be a request your application sends to the AI Gateway. Once the request is made, the response will contain various pieces of metadata.
2. **Check the Response Headers**: The response will include a header named `cf-aig-log-id`. This is the identifier you will need to submit feedback.

In the example below, the `cf-aig-log-id` is `01JADMCQQQBWH3NXZ5GCRN98DP`.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "headers": {
    "cf-aig-log-id": "01JADMCQQQBWH3NXZ5GCRN98DP"
  },
  "data": {
    "response": "Sample response data"
  }
}
```

### Method 2: Retrieve the `cf-aig-log-id` via API (GET request)

If you do not have the `cf-aig-log-id` in the response body or you need to access it after the fact, you are able to retrieve it by querying the logs using the [Cloudflare API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai_gateway/subresources/logs/methods/list/).

Send a `GET` request to get a list of logs and then find a specific ID

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:

* `AI Gateway Write`
* `AI Gateway Read`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/ai-gateway/gateways/$GATEWAY_ID/logs" \
  --request GET \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"
```

```json
{
  "result": [
    {
      "id": "01JADMCQQQBWH3NXZ5GCRN98DP",
      "cached": true,
      "created_at": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z",
      "custom_cost": true,
      "duration": 0,
      "id": "string",
      "metadata": "string",
      "model": "string",
      "model_type": "string",
      "path": "string",
      "provider": "string",
      "request_content_type": "string",
      "request_type": "string",
      "response_content_type": "string",
      "status_code": 0,
      "step": 0,
      "success": true,
      "tokens_in": 0,
      "tokens_out": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### Method 3: Retrieve the `cf-aig-log-id` via a binding

You can also retrieve the `cf-aig-log-id` using a binding, which streamlines the process. Here's how to retrieve the log ID directly:

```js
const resp = await env.AI.run(
  "@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct",
  {
    prompt: "tell me a joke",
  },
  {
    gateway: {
      id: "my_gateway_id",
    },
  },
);


const myLogId = env.AI.aiGatewayLogId;
```

Note:

The `aiGatewayLogId` property, will only hold the last inference call log id.

## 3. Submit feedback via PATCH request

Once you have both the API token and the `cf-aig-log-id`, you can send a PATCH request to submit feedback.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:

* `AI Gateway Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/ai-gateway/gateways/$GATEWAY_ID/logs/$ID" \
  --request PATCH \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
  --json '{
    "feedback": 1
  }'
```

If you had negative feedback, adjust the body of the request to be `-1`.

```json
{
  "feedback": -1
}
```

## 4. Verify the feedback submission

You can verify the feedback submission in two ways:

* **Through the [Cloudflare dashboard ](https://dash.cloudflare.com)**: check the updated feedback on the AI Gateway interface.
* **Through the API**: Send another GET request to retrieve the updated log entry and confirm the feedback has been recorded.

title: Add human feedback using Worker Bindings · Cloudflare AI Gateway docs
description: This guide explains how to provide human feedback for AI Gateway
  evaluations using Worker bindings.
lastUpdated: 2025-08-19T11:42:14.000Z
chatbotDeprioritize: true
source_url:
  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/evaluations/add-human-feedback-bindings/
  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/evaluations/add-human-feedback-bindings/index.md
---

This guide explains how to provide human feedback for AI Gateway evaluations using Worker bindings.

## 1. Run an AI Evaluation

Start by sending a prompt to the AI model through your AI Gateway.

```javascript
const resp = await env.AI.run(
  "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
  {
    prompt: "tell me a joke",
  },
  {
    gateway: {
      id: "my-gateway",
    },
  },
);


const myLogId = env.AI.aiGatewayLogId;
```

Let the user interact with or evaluate the AI response. This interaction will inform the feedback you send back to the AI Gateway.

## 2. Send Human Feedback

Use the [`patchLog()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/integrations/worker-binding-methods/#31-patchlog-send-feedback) method to provide feedback for the AI evaluation.

```javascript
await env.AI.gateway("my-gateway").patchLog(myLogId, {
  feedback: 1, // all fields are optional; set values that fit your use case
  score: 100,
  metadata: {
    user: "123", // Optional metadata to provide additional context
  },
});
```

## Feedback parameters explanation

* `feedback`: is either `-1` for negative or `1` to positive, `0` is considered not evaluated.
* `score`: A number between 0 and 100.
* `metadata`: An object containing additional contextual information.

### patchLog: Send Feedback

The `patchLog` method allows you to send feedback, score, and metadata for a specific log ID. All object properties are optional, so you can include any combination of the parameters:

```javascript
gateway.patchLog("my-log-id", {
  feedback: 1,
  score: 100,
  metadata: {
    user: "123",
  },
});
```

Returns: `Promise<void>` (Make sure to `await` the request.)

  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/evaluations/set-up-evaluations/index.md
---

This guide walks you through the process of setting up an evaluation in AI Gateway. These steps are done in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).

## 1. Select or create a dataset

Datasets are collections of logs stored for analysis that can be used in an evaluation. You can create datasets by applying filters in the Logs tab. Datasets will update automatically based on the set filters.

### Set up a dataset from the Logs tab

1. Apply filters to narrow down your logs. Filter options include provider, number of tokens, request status, and more.
2. Select **Create Dataset** to store the filtered logs for future analysis.

You can manage datasets by selecting **Manage datasets** from the Logs tab.

Note

Please keep in mind that datasets currently use `AND` joins, so there can only be one item per filter (for example, one model or one provider). Future updates will allow more flexibility in dataset creation.

### List of available filters

| Filter category | Filter options | Filter by description |
| - | - | - |
| Status | error, status | error type or status. |
| Cache | cached, not cached | based on whether they were cached or not. |
| Provider | specific providers | the selected AI provider. |
| AI Models | specific models | the selected AI model. |
| Cost | less than, greater than | cost, specifying a threshold. |
| Request type | Universal, Workers AI Binding, WebSockets | the type of request. |
| Tokens | Total tokens, Tokens In, Tokens Out | token count (less than or greater than). |
| Duration | less than, greater than | request duration. |
| Feedback | equals, does not equal (thumbs up, thumbs down, no feedback) | feedback type. |
| Metadata Key | equals, does not equal | specific metadata keys. |
| Metadata Value | equals, does not equal | specific metadata values. |
| Log ID | equals, does not equal | a specific Log ID. |
| Event ID | equals, does not equal | a specific Event ID. |

## 2. Select evaluators

After creating a dataset, choose the evaluation parameters:

* Cost: Calculates the average cost of inference requests within the dataset (only for requests with [cost data](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/costs/)).
* Speed: Calculates the average duration of inference requests within the dataset.
* Performance:
  * Human feedback: measures performance based on human feedback, calculated by the % of thumbs up on the logs, annotated from the Logs tab.

Note

Additional evaluators will be introduced in future updates to expand performance analysis capabilities.

## 3. Name, review, and run the evaluation

1. Create a unique name for your evaluation to reference it in the dashboard.
2. Review the selected dataset and evaluators.
3. Select **Run** to start the process.

## 4. Review and analyze results

Evaluation results will appear in the Evaluations tab. The results show the status of the evaluation (for example, in progress, completed, or error). Metrics for the selected evaluators will be displayed, excluding any logs with missing fields. You will also see the number of logs used to calculate each metric.

While datasets automatically update based on filters, evaluations do not. You will have to create a new evaluation if you want to evaluate new logs.

Use these insights to optimize based on your application's priorities. Based on the results, you may choose to:

* Change the model or [provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/)
* Adjust your prompts
* Explore further optimizations, such as setting up [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-rag/)

title: Caching · Cloudflare AI Gateway docs
description: Override caching settings on a per-request basis.

  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching/index.md

AI Gateway can cache responses from your AI model providers, serving them directly from Cloudflare's cache for identical requests.

## Benefits of Using Caching

* **Reduced Latency:** Serve responses faster to your users by avoiding a round trip to the origin AI provider for repeated requests.
* **Cost Savings:** Minimize the number of paid requests made to your AI provider, especially for frequently accessed or non-dynamic content.
* **Increased Throughput:** Offload repetitive requests from your AI provider, allowing it to handle unique requests more efficiently.

Note

Currently caching is supported only for text and image responses, and it applies only to identical requests.

This configuration benefits use cases with limited prompt options. For example, a support bot that asks "How can I help you?" and lets the user select an answer from a limited set of options works well with the current caching configuration. We plan on adding semantic search for caching in the future to improve cache hit rates.

## Default configuration

* Dashboard

  To set the default caching configuration in the dashboard:

  1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
  2. Select **AI** > **AI Gateway**.
  3. Select **Settings**.
  4. Enable **Cache Responses**.
  5. Change the default caching to whatever value you prefer.

* API

  To set the default caching configuration using the API:

  1. [Create an API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with the following permissions:

  * `AI Gateway - Read`
  * `AI Gateway - Edit`

  1. Get your [Account ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/).
  2. Using that API token and Account ID, send a [`POST` request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai_gateway/methods/create/) to create a new Gateway and include a value for the `cache_ttl`.

This caching behavior will be uniformly applied to all requests that support caching. If you need to modify the cache settings for specific requests, you have the flexibility to override this setting on a per-request basis.

To check whether a response comes from cache or not, **cf-aig-cache-status** will be designated as `HIT` or `MISS`.

## Per-request caching

While your gateway's default cache settings provide a good baseline, you might need more granular control. These situations could be data freshness, content with varying lifespans, or dynamic or personalized responses.

To address these needs, AI Gateway allows you to override default cache behaviors on a per-request basis using specific HTTP headers. This gives you the precision to optimize caching for individual API calls.

The following headers allow you to define this per-request cache behavior:

Note

The following headers have been updated to new names, though the old headers will still function. We recommend updating to the new headers to ensure future compatibility:

`cf-cache-ttl` is now `cf-aig-cache-ttl`

`cf-skip-cache` is now `cf-aig-skip-cache`

### Skip cache (cf-aig-skip-cache)

Skip cache refers to bypassing the cache and fetching the request directly from the original provider, without utilizing any cached copy.

You can use the header **cf-aig-skip-cache** to bypass the cached version of the request.

As an example, when submitting a request to OpenAI, include the header in the following manner:

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai/chat/completions \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'cf-aig-skip-cache: true' \
  --data ' {
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "how to build a wooden spoon in 3 short steps? give as short as answer as possible"
          }
        ]
      }
'
```

### Cache TTL (cf-aig-cache-ttl)

Cache TTL, or Time To Live, is the duration a cached request remains valid before it expires and is refreshed from the original source. You can use **cf-aig-cache-ttl** to set the desired caching duration in seconds. The minimum TTL is 60 seconds and the maximum TTL is one month.

For example, if you set a TTL of one hour, it means that a request is kept in the cache for an hour. Within that hour, an identical request will be served from the cache instead of the original API. After an hour, the cache expires and the request will go to the original API for a fresh response, and that response will repopulate the cache for the next hour.

As an example, when submitting a request to OpenAI, include the header in the following manner:

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai/chat/completions \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'cf-aig-cache-ttl: 3600' \
  --data ' {
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "how to build a wooden spoon in 3 short steps? give as short as answer as possible"
          }
        ]
      }
'
```

### Custom cache key (cf-aig-cache-key)

Custom cache keys let you override the default cache key in order to precisely set the cacheability setting for any resource. To override the default cache key, you can use the header **cf-aig-cache-key**.

When you use the **cf-aig-cache-key** header for the first time, you will receive a response from the provider. Subsequent requests with the same header will return the cached response. If the **cf-aig-cache-ttl** header is used, responses will be cached according to the specified Cache Time To Live. Otherwise, responses will be cached according to the cache settings in the dashboard. If caching is not enabled for the gateway, responses will be cached for 5 minutes by default.

As an example, when submitting a request to OpenAI, include the header in the following manner:

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai/chat/completions \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {openai_token}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'cf-aig-cache-key: responseA' \
  --data ' {
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "how to build a wooden spoon in 3 short steps? give as short as answer as possible"
          }
        ]
      }
'
```

AI Gateway caching behavior

Cache in AI Gateway is volatile. If two identical requests are sent simultaneously, the first request may not cache in time for the second request to use it, which may result in the second request retrieving data from the original source.

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) for AI Gateway helps protect your organization from inadvertent exposure of sensitive data through AI interactions. By integrating with Cloudflare's proven DLP technology, AI Gateway can scan both incoming prompts and outgoing AI responses for sensitive information, ensuring your AI applications maintain security and compliance standards.

## How it works

AI Gateway DLP leverages the same powerful detection engines used in [Cloudflare's Data Loss Prevention](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/) solution to scan AI traffic in real-time. The system analyzes both user prompts sent to AI models and responses received from AI providers, identifying sensitive data patterns and taking appropriate protective actions.

## Key benefits

* **Prevent data leakage**: Stop sensitive information from being inadvertently shared with AI providers or exposed in AI responses
* **Maintain compliance**: Help meet regulatory requirements like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS
* **Consistent protection**: Apply the same DLP policies across all AI providers and models
* **Audit visibility**: Comprehensive logging and reporting for security and compliance teams
* **Zero-code integration**: Enable protection without modifying existing AI applications

## Supported AI traffic

AI Gateway DLP can scan:

* **User prompts** - Content submitted to AI models, including text, code, and structured data
* **AI responses** - Output generated by AI models before being returned to users

The system works with all AI providers supported by AI Gateway, providing consistent protection regardless of which models or services you use.

## Integration with Cloudflare DLP

AI Gateway DLP uses the same detection profiles and policies as Cloudflare's enterprise DLP solution. This means:

* **Unified management** - Configure DLP policies once and apply them across web traffic, email, SaaS applications, and AI interactions
* **Consistent detection** - The same sensitive data patterns are detected across all channels
* **Centralized reporting** - All DLP events appear in the same dashboard and logs
* **Shared profiles** - Reuse existing DLP detection profiles for AI traffic

For more information about Cloudflare's DLP capabilities, refer to the [Data Loss Prevention documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/).

## Getting started

To enable DLP for your AI Gateway:

1. [Set up DLP policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/dlp/set-up-dlp/) for your AI Gateway
2. Configure detection profiles and response actions
3. Monitor DLP events through the Cloudflare dashboard

## Introduction

Dynamic routing enables you to create request routing flows through a **visual interface** or a **JSON-based configuration**. Instead of hard-coding a single model, with Dynamic Routing you compose a small flow that evaluates conditions, enforces quotas, and chooses models with fallbacks. You can iterate without touching application code—publish a new route version and you’re done. With dynamic routing, you can easily implement advanced use cases such as:

* Directing different segments (paid/not-paid user) to different models
* Restricting each user/project/team with budget/rate limits
* A/B and gradual rollouts

while making it accessible to both developers and non-technical team members.

![Dynamic Routing Overview](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/dynamic-routing.BtwkWywo_ZkRSjM.webp)

## Core Concepts

* **Route**: A named, versioned flow (for example, dynamic/support) that you can use as instead of the model name in your requests.

* **Nodes**

  * **Start**: Entry point for the route.
  * **Conditional**: If/Else branch based on expressions that reference request body, headers, or metadata (for example, user\_plan == "paid").
  * **Percentage**: Routes requests probabilistically across multiple outputs, useful for A/B testing and gradual rollouts.
  * **Model**: Calls a provider/model with the request parameters
  * **Rate Limit**: Enforces number of requests quotas (per your key, per period) and switches to fallback when exceeded.
  * **Budget Limit**: Enforces cost quotas (per your key, per period) and switches to fallback when exceeded.
  * **End**: Terminates the flow and returns the final model response.

* **Metadata**: Arbitrary key-value context attached to the request (for example, userId, orgId, plan). You can pass this from your app so rules can reference it.

* **Versions**: Each change produces a new draft. Deploy to make it live with instant rollback.

## Getting Started

Warning

Ensure your gateway has [authentication](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/authentication/) turned on, and you have your upstream providers keys stored with [BYOK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/bring-your-own-keys/).

1. Create a route.

   * Go to **(Select your gateway)** > **Dynamic Routes** > **Add Route**, and name it (for example, `support`).
   * Open **Editor**.

2. Define conditionals, limits and other settings.
   * You can use [Custom Metadata](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/custom-metadata/) in your conditionals.

3. Configure model nodes.

   * Example:

     * Node A: Provider OpenAI, Model `o4-mini-high`
     * Node B: Provider OpenAI, Model `gpt-4.1`

4. Save a version.

   * Click **Save** to save the state. You can always roll back to earlier versions from **Versions**.
   * Deploy the version to make it live.

5. Call the route from your code.
   * Use the [OpenAI compatible](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/chat-completion/) endpoint, and use the route name in place of the model, for example, `dynamic/support`.

Guardrails help you deploy AI applications safely by intercepting and evaluating both user prompts and model responses for harmful content. Acting as a proxy between your application and [model providers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/) (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and others), AI Gateway's Guardrails ensure a consistent and secure experience across your entire AI ecosystem.

Guardrails proactively monitor interactions between users and AI models, giving you:

* **Consistent moderation**: Uniform moderation layer that works across models and providers.
* **Enhanced safety and user trust**: Proactively protect users from harmful or inappropriate interactions.
* **Flexibility and control over allowed content**: Specify which categories to monitor and choose between flagging or outright blocking.
* **Auditing and compliance capabilities**: Receive updates on evolving regulatory requirements with logs of user prompts, model responses, and enforced guardrails.

## Video demo

## How Guardrails work

AI Gateway inspects all interactions in real time by evaluating content against predefined safety parameters. Guardrails work by:

1. Intercepting interactions: AI Gateway proxies requests and responses, sitting between the user and the AI model.

2. Inspecting content:

   * User prompts: AI Gateway checks prompts against safety parameters (for example, violence, hate, or sexual content). Based on your settings, prompts can be flagged or blocked before reaching the model.
   * Model responses: Once processed, the AI model response is inspected. If hazardous content is detected, it can be flagged or blocked before being delivered to the user.

3. Applying actions: Depending on your configuration, flagged content is logged for review, while blocked content is prevented from proceeding.

title: Rate limiting · Cloudflare AI Gateway docs
description: Rate limiting controls the traffic that reaches your application,
  which prevents expensive bills and suspicious activity.
lastUpdated: 2025-08-19T11:42:14.000Z

  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/rate-limiting/index.md
---

Rate limiting controls the traffic that reaches your application, which prevents expensive bills and suspicious activity.

## Parameters

You can define rate limits as the number of requests that get sent in a specific time frame. For example, you can limit your application to 100 requests per 60 seconds.

You can also select if you would like a **fixed** or **sliding** rate limiting technique. With rate limiting, we allow a certain number of requests within a window of time. For example, if it is a fixed rate, the window is based on time, so there would be no more than `x` requests in a ten minute window. If it is a sliding rate, there would be no more than `x` requests in the last ten minutes.

To illustrate this, let us say you had a limit of ten requests per ten minutes, starting at 12:00. So the fixed window is 12:00-12:10, 12:10-12:20, and so on. If you sent ten requests at 12:09 and ten requests at 12:11, all 20 requests would be successful in a fixed window strategy. However, they would fail in a sliding window strategy since there were more than ten requests in the last ten minutes.

## Handling rate limits

When your requests exceed the allowed rate, you will encounter rate limiting. This means the server will respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code and your request will not be processed.

## Default configuration

* Dashboard

  To set the default rate limiting configuration in the dashboard:

  1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
  2. Go to **AI** > **AI Gateway**.
  3. Go to **Settings**.
  4. Enable **Rate-limiting**.
  5. Adjust the rate, time period, and rate limiting method as desired.

* API

  To set the default rate limiting configuration using the API:

  1. [Create an API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with the following permissions:

  * `AI Gateway - Read`
  * `AI Gateway - Edit`

  1. Get your [Account ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/).
  2. Using that API token and Account ID, send a [`POST` request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai_gateway/methods/create/) to create a new Gateway and include a value for the `rate_limiting_interval`, `rate_limiting_limit`, and `rate_limiting_technique`.

This rate limiting behavior will be uniformly applied to all requests for that gateway.

title: Unified Billing · Cloudflare AI Gateway docs
description: Use the Cloudflare billing to pay for and authenticate your inference requests.

source_url:
  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/unified-billing/
  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/unified-billing/index.md
---

Unified Billing allows users to connect to various AI providers (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI Studio) and receive a single Cloudflare bill. To use Unified Billing, you must purchase and load credits into your Cloudflare account in the Cloudflare dashboard, which you can then spend with AI Gateway.

## Pre-requisites

* Ensure your Cloudflare account has [sufficient credits loaded](#load-credits).
* Ensure you have [authenticated](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/authentication/) your AI Gateway.

## Load credits

To load credits for AI Gateway:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **AI Gateway** page.

   [Go to **AI Gateway**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-gateway)

   The **Credits Available** card on the top right shows how many AI gateway credits you have on your account currently.

2. In **Credits Available**, select **Manage**.

3. If your account does not have an available payment method, AI Gateway will prompt you to add a payment method to purchase credits. Add a payment method.

4. Select **Top-up credits**.

5. Add the amount of credits you want to purchase, then select **Confirm and pay**.

### Auto-top up

You can configure AI Gateway to automatically replenish your credits when they fall below a certain threshold. To configure auto top-up:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **AI Gateway** page.

   [Go to **AI Gateway**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-gateway)

2. In **Credits Available**, select **Manage**.

3. Select **Setup auto top-up credits**.

4. Choose a threshold and a recharge amount for auto top-up.

When your balance falls below the set threshold, AI Gateway will automatically apply the auto top-up amount to your account.

## Use Unified Billing

Call any supported provider without passing an API Key. The request will automatically use Cloudflare's key and deduct credits from your account.

For example, you can use the Unified API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/compat/chat/completions \
  --header 'cf-aig-authorization: Bearer {CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "model": "google-ai-studio/gemini-2.5-pro",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Spend limits

Set spend limits to prevent unexpected charges on your loaded credits. You can define daily, weekly, or monthly limits. When a limit is reached, the AI Gateway automatically stops processing requests until the period resets or you increase the limit.

### Supported providers

Unified Billing supports the following AI providers:

* [OpenAI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/openai/)
* [Anthropic](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/anthropic/)
* [Google AI Studio](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/google-ai-studio/)
* [xAI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/grok/)
* [Groq](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/groq/)

---

This guide will walk you through setting up and deploying a Workers AI project. You will use [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), an AI Gateway binding, and a large language model (LLM), to deploy your first AI-powered application on the Cloudflare global network.

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages).
2. Install [`Node.js`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Node.js version manager

Use a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues and change Node.js versions. [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), discussed later in this guide, requires a Node version of `16.17.0` or later.

## 1. Create a Worker Project

You will create a new Worker project using the create-Cloudflare CLI (C3). C3 is a command-line tool designed to help you set up and deploy new applications to Cloudflare.

Create a new project named `hello-ai` by running:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm create cloudflare@latest -- hello-ai
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn create cloudflare hello-ai
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm create cloudflare@latest hello-ai
  ```

Running `npm create cloudflare@latest` will prompt you to install the create-cloudflare package and lead you through setup. C3 will also install [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), the Cloudflare Developer Platform CLI.

For setup, select the following options:

* For *What would you like to start with?*, choose `Hello World example`.
* For *Which template would you like to use?*, choose `Worker only`.
* For *Which language do you want to use?*, choose `TypeScript`.
* For *Do you want to use git for version control?*, choose `Yes`.
* For *Do you want to deploy your application?*, choose `No` (we will be making some changes before deploying).

This will create a new `hello-ai` directory. Your new `hello-ai` directory will include:

* A "Hello World" Worker at `src/index.ts`.
* A [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/)

Go to your application directory:

```bash
cd hello-ai
```

## 2. Connect your Worker to Workers AI

You must create an AI binding for your Worker to connect to Workers AI. Bindings allow your Workers to interact with resources, like Workers AI, on the Cloudflare Developer Platform.

To bind Workers AI to your Worker, add the following to the end of your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "ai": {
      "binding": "AI"
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [ai]
  binding = "AI"
  ```

Your binding is [available in your Worker code](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/#bindings-in-es-modules-format) on [`env.AI`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/).

You will need to have your `gateway id` for the next step. You can learn [how to create an AI Gateway in this tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/get-started/).

## 3. Run an inference task containing AI Gateway in your Worker

You are now ready to run an inference task in your Worker. In this case, you will use an LLM, [`llama-3.1-8b-instruct-fast`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-fast/), to answer a question. Your gateway ID is found on the dashboard.

Update the `index.ts` file in your `hello-ai` application directory with the following code:

```typescript
export interface Env {
  // If you set another name in the [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) as the value for 'binding',
  // replace "AI" with the variable name you defined.
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
    // Specify the gateway label and other options here
    const response = await env.AI.run(
      "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-fast",
      {
        prompt: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      },
      {
        gateway: {
          id: "GATEWAYID", // Use your gateway label here
          skipCache: true, // Optional: Skip cache if needed
        },
      },
    );


    // Return the AI response as a JSON object
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(response), {
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    });
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Up to this point, you have created an AI binding for your Worker and configured your Worker to be able to execute the Llama 3.1 model. You can now test your project locally before you deploy globally.

## 4. Develop locally with Wrangler

While in your project directory, test Workers AI locally by running [`wrangler dev`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev):

```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

Workers AI local development usage charges

Using Workers AI always accesses your Cloudflare account in order to run AI models and will incur usage charges even in local development.

You will be prompted to log in after you run `wrangler dev`. When you run `npx wrangler dev`, Wrangler will give you a URL (most likely `localhost:8787`) to review your Worker. After you go to the URL Wrangler provides, you will see a message that resembles the following example:

````json
{
  "response": "A fascinating question!\n\nThe phrase \"Hello, World!\" originates from a simple computer program written in the early days of programming. It is often attributed to Brian Kernighan, a Canadian computer scientist and a pioneer in the field of computer programming.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Kernighan, along with his colleague Dennis Ritchie, were working on the C programming language. They wanted to create a simple program that would output a message to the screen to demonstrate the basic structure of a program. They chose the phrase \"Hello, World!\" because it was a simple and recognizable message that would illustrate how a program could print text to the screen.\n\nThe exact code was written in the 5th edition of Kernighan and Ritchie's book \"The C Programming Language,\" published in 1988. The code, literally known as \"Hello, World!\" is as follows:\n\n```
main()
{
  printf(\"Hello, World!\");
}
```\n\nThis code is still often used as a starting point for learning programming languages, as it demonstrates how to output a simple message to the console.\n\nThe phrase \"Hello, World!\" has since become a catch-all phrase to indicate the start of a new program or a small test program, and is widely used in computer science and programming education.\n\nSincerely, I'm glad I could help clarify the origin of this iconic phrase for you!"
}
````

## 5. Deploy your AI Worker

Before deploying your AI Worker globally, log in with your Cloudflare account by running:

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

You will be directed to a web page asking you to log in to the Cloudflare dashboard. After you have logged in, you will be asked if Wrangler can make changes to your Cloudflare account. Scroll down and select **Allow** to continue.

Finally, deploy your Worker to make your project accessible on the Internet. To deploy your Worker, run:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

Once deployed, your Worker will be available at a URL like:

```bash
https://hello-ai.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev
```

Your Worker will be deployed to your custom [`workers.dev`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/) subdomain. You can now visit the URL to run your AI Worker.

By completing this tutorial, you have created a Worker, connected it to Workers AI through an AI Gateway binding, and successfully ran an inference task using the Llama 3.1 model.

### Fallback Providers

To specify model or provider fallbacks to handle request failures and ensure reliability, you can pass an array of models to the `model` option.

```js
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: aigateway([
    openai.chat("gpt-5.1"), anthropic("claude-sonnet-4-5")
  ]),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});

This guide provides an overview of how to use the latest Cloudflare Workers AI Gateway binding methods. You will learn how to set up an AI Gateway binding, access new methods, and integrate them into your Workers.

## 1. Add an AI Binding to your Worker

To connect your Worker to Workers AI, add the following to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "ai": {
      "binding": "AI"
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [ai]
  binding = "AI"
  ```

This configuration sets up the AI binding accessible in your Worker code as `env.AI`.

If you're using TypeScript, run [`wrangler types`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#types) whenever you modify your Wrangler configuration file. This generates types for the `env` object based on your bindings, as well as [runtime types](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/typescript/).

## 2. Basic Usage with Workers AI + Gateway

To perform an inference task using Workers AI and an AI Gateway, you can use the following code:

```typescript
const resp = await env.AI.run(
  "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
  {
    prompt: "tell me a joke",
  },
  {
    gateway: {
      id: "my-gateway",
    },
  },
);
```

Additionally, you can access the latest request log ID with:

```typescript
const myLogId = env.AI.aiGatewayLogId;
```

## 3. Access the Gateway Binding

You can access your AI Gateway binding using the following code:

```typescript
const gateway = env.AI.gateway("my-gateway");
```

Once you have the gateway instance, you can use the following methods:

### 3.1. `patchLog`: Send Feedback

The `patchLog` method allows you to send feedback, score, and metadata for a specific log ID. All object properties are optional, so you can include any combination of the parameters:

```typescript
gateway.patchLog("my-log-id", {
  feedback: 1,
  score: 100,
  metadata: {
    user: "123",
  },
});
```

* **Returns**: `Promise<void>` (Make sure to `await` the request.)
* **Example Use Case**: Update a log entry with user feedback or additional metadata.

### 3.2. `getLog`: Read Log Details

The `getLog` method retrieves details of a specific log ID. It returns an object of type `Promise<AiGatewayLog>`. If this type is missing, ensure you have run [`wrangler types`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/typescript/#generate-types).

```typescript
const log = await gateway.getLog("my-log-id");
```

* **Returns**: `Promise<AiGatewayLog>`
* **Example Use Case**: Retrieve log information for debugging or analytics.

### 3.3. `getUrl`: Get Gateway URLs

The `getUrl` method allows you to retrieve the base URL for your AI Gateway, optionally specifying a provider to get the provider-specific endpoint.

```typescript
// Get the base gateway URL
const baseUrl = await gateway.getUrl();
// Output: https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/my-account-id/my-gateway/


// Get a provider-specific URL
const openaiUrl = await gateway.getUrl("openai");
// Output: https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/my-account-id/my-gateway/openai
```

* **Parameters**: Optional `provider` (string or `AIGatewayProviders` enum)
* **Returns**: `Promise<string>`
* **Example Use Case**: Dynamically construct URLs for direct API calls or debugging configurations.

#### SDK Integration Examples

The `getUrl` method is particularly useful for integrating with popular AI SDKs:

**OpenAI SDK:**

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";


const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "my api key", // defaults to process.env["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
  baseURL: await env.AI.gateway("my-gateway").getUrl("openai"),
});
```

**Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI:**

```typescript
import { createOpenAI } from "@ai-sdk/openai";


const openai = createOpenAI({
  baseURL: await env.AI.gateway("my-gateway").getUrl("openai"),
});
```

**Vercel AI SDK with Anthropic:**

```typescript
import { createAnthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";


const anthropic = createAnthropic({
  baseURL: await env.AI.gateway("my-gateway").getUrl("anthropic"),
});
```

### 3.4. `run`: Universal Requests

The `run` method allows you to execute universal requests. Users can pass either a single universal request object or an array of them. This method supports all AI Gateway providers.

Refer to the [Universal endpoint documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/universal/) for details about the available inputs.

```typescript
const resp = await gateway.run({
  provider: "workers-ai",
  endpoint: "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
  headers: {
    authorization: "Bearer my-api-token",
  },
  query: {
    prompt: "tell me a joke",
  },
});
```

* **Returns**: `Promise<Response>`
* **Example Use Case**: Perform a [universal request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/universal/) to any supported provider.

## Conclusion

With these AI Gateway binding methods, you can now:

* Send feedback and update metadata with `patchLog`.
* Retrieve detailed log information using `getLog`.
* Get gateway URLs for direct API access with `getUrl`, making it easy to integrate with popular AI SDKs.
* Execute universal requests to any AI Gateway provider with `run`.

These methods offer greater flexibility and control over your AI integrations, empowering you to build more sophisticated applications on the Cloudflare Workers platform.

Cost metrics are only available for endpoints where the models return token data and the model name in their responses.

## Track costs across AI providers

AI Gateway makes it easier to monitor and estimate token based costs across all your AI providers. This can help you:

* Understand and compare usage costs between providers.
* Monitor trends and estimate spend using consistent metrics.
* Apply custom pricing logic to match negotiated rates.

Note

The cost metric is an **estimation** based on the number of tokens sent and received in requests. While this metric can help you monitor and predict cost trends, refer to your provider's dashboard for the most **accurate** cost details.

Caution

Providers may introduce new models or change their pricing. If you notice outdated cost data or are using a model not yet supported by our cost tracking, please [submit a request](https://forms.gle/8kRa73wRnvq7bxL48)

## Custom costs

AI Gateway allows users to set custom costs when operating under special pricing agreements or negotiated rates. Custom costs can be applied at the request level, and when applied, they will override the default or public model costs. For more information on configuration of custom costs, please visit the [Custom Costs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/custom-costs/) configuration page.

Custom metadata in AI Gateway allows you to tag requests with user IDs or other identifiers, enabling better tracking and analysis of your requests. Metadata values can be strings, numbers, or booleans, and will appear in your logs, making it easy to search and filter through your data.

## Key Features

* **Custom Tagging**: Add user IDs, team names, test indicators, and other relevant information to your requests.
* **Enhanced Logging**: Metadata appears in your logs, allowing for detailed inspection and troubleshooting.
* **Search and Filter**: Use metadata to efficiently search and filter through logged requests.

Note

AI Gateway allows you to pass up to five custom metadata entries per request. If more than five entries are provided, only the first five will be saved; additional entries will be ignored. Ensure your custom metadata is limited to five entries to avoid unprocessed or lost data.

## Supported Metadata Types

* String
* Number
* Boolean

Note

Objects are not supported as metadata values.

## Implementations

### Using cURL

To include custom metadata in your request using cURL:

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai/chat/completions \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {api_token}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'cf-aig-metadata: {"team": "AI", "user": 12345, "test":true}' \
  --data '{"model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What should I eat for lunch?"}]}'
```

### Using SDK

To include custom metadata in your request using the OpenAI SDK:

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";


export default {
 async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
   const openai = new OpenAI({
     apiKey: env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
     baseURL: "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai",
   });


   try {
     const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create(
       {
         model: "gpt-4o",
         messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What should I eat for lunch?" }],
         max_tokens: 50,
       },
       {
         headers: {
           "cf-aig-metadata": JSON.stringify({
             user: "JaneDoe",
             team: 12345,
             test: true
           }),
         },
       }
     );


     const response = chatCompletion.choices[0].message;
     return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
   } catch (e) {
     console.log(e);
     return new Response(e);
   }
 },
};
```

### Using Binding

To include custom metadata in your request using [Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/):

```javascript
export default {
 async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
   const aiResp = await env.AI.run(
       '@cf/mistral/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1',
       { prompt: 'What should I eat for lunch?' },
       { gateway: { id: 'gateway_id', metadata: { "team": "AI", "user": 12345, "test": true} } }
   );


   return new Response(aiResp);
 },
};
```

Logging is a fundamental building block for application development. Logs provide insights during the early stages of development and are often critical to understanding issues occurring in production.

Your AI Gateway dashboard shows logs of individual requests, including the user prompt, model response, provider, timestamp, request status, token usage, cost, and duration. These logs persist, giving you the flexibility to store them for your preferred duration and do more with valuable request data.

By default, each gateway can store up to 10 million logs. You can customize this limit per gateway in your gateway settings to align with your specific requirements. If your storage limit is reached, new logs will stop being saved. To continue saving logs, you must delete older logs to free up space for new logs. To learn more about your plan limits, refer to [Limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/reference/limits/).

We recommend using an authenticated gateway when storing logs to prevent unauthorized access and protects against invalid requests that can inflate log storage usage and make it harder to find the data you need. Learn more about setting up an [authenticated gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/authentication/).

## Default configuration

Logs, which include metrics as well as request and response data, are enabled by default for each gateway. This logging behavior will be uniformly applied to all requests in the gateway. If you are concerned about privacy or compliance and want to turn log collection off, you can go to settings and opt out of logs. If you need to modify the log settings for specific requests, you can override this setting on a per-request basis.

To change the default log configuration in the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **AI Gateway** page.

   [Go to **AI Gateway**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-gateway)

2. Select **Settings**.

3. Change the **Logs** setting to your preference.

## Per-request logging

To override the default logging behavior set in the settings tab, you can define headers on a per-request basis.

### Collect logs (`cf-aig-collect-log`)

The `cf-aig-collect-log` header allows you to bypass the default log setting for the gateway. If the gateway is configured to save logs, the header will exclude the log for that specific request. Conversely, if logging is disabled at the gateway level, this header will save the log for that request.

In the example below, we use `cf-aig-collect-log` to bypass the default setting to avoid saving the log.

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai/chat/completions \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'cf-aig-collect-log: false \
  --data ' {
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is the email address and phone number of user123?"
          }
        ]
      }
'
```

## Managing log storage

To manage your log storage effectively, you can:

* Set Storage Limits: Configure a limit on the number of logs stored per gateway in your gateway settings to ensure you only pay for what you need.
* Enable Automatic Log Deletion: Activate the Automatic Log Deletion feature in your gateway settings to automatically delete the oldest logs once the log limit you've set or the default storage limit of 10 million logs is reached. This ensures new logs are always saved without manual intervention.

## How to delete logs

To manage your log storage effectively and ensure continuous logging, you can delete logs using the following methods:

### Automatic Log Deletion

​To maintain continuous logging within your gateway's storage constraints, enable Automatic Log Deletion in your Gateway settings. This feature automatically deletes the oldest logs once the log limit you've set or the default storage limit of 10 million logs is reached, ensuring new logs are saved without manual intervention.

### Manual deletion

To manually delete logs through the dashboard, navigate to the Logs tab in the dashboard. Use the available filters such as status, cache, provider, cost, or any other options in the dropdown to refine the logs you wish to delete. Once filtered, select Delete logs to complete the action.

See full list of available filters and their descriptions below:

| Filter category | Filter options | Filter by description |
| - | - | - |
| Status | error, status | error type or status. |
| Cache | cached, not cached | based on whether they were cached or not. |
| Provider | specific providers | the selected AI provider. |
| AI Models | specific models | the selected AI model. |
| Cost | less than, greater than | cost, specifying a threshold. |
| Request type | Universal, Workers AI Binding, WebSockets | the type of request. |
| Tokens | Total tokens, Tokens In, Tokens Out | token count (less than or greater than). |
| Duration | less than, greater than | request duration. |
| Feedback | equals, does not equal (thumbs up, thumbs down, no feedback) | feedback type. |
| Metadata Key | equals, does not equal | specific metadata keys. |
| Metadata Value | equals, does not equal | specific metadata values. |
| Log ID | equals, does not equal | a specific Log ID. |
| Event ID | equals, does not equal | a specific Event ID. |

### API deletion

You can programmatically delete logs using the AI Gateway API. For more comprehensive information on the `DELETE` logs endpoint, check out the [Cloudflare API documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai_gateway/subresources/logs/methods/delete/).

title: Create your first AI Gateway using Workers AI · Cloudflare AI Gateway docs
description: This tutorial guides you through creating your first AI Gateway
  using Workers AI on the Cloudflare dashboard.
lastUpdated: 2025-10-09T15:47:46.000Z
chatbotDeprioritize: false

  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/tutorials/create-first-aig-workers/index.md
---

This tutorial guides you through creating your first AI Gateway using Workers AI on the Cloudflare dashboard. The intended audience is beginners who are new to AI Gateway and Workers AI. Creating an AI Gateway enables the user to efficiently manage and secure AI requests, allowing them to utilize AI models for tasks such as content generation, data processing, or predictive analysis with enhanced control and performance.

## Sign up and log in

1. **Sign up**: If you do not have a Cloudflare account, [sign up](https://cloudflare.com/sign-up).
2. **Log in**: Access the Cloudflare dashboard by logging in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).

## Create gateway

Then, create a new AI Gateway.

* Dashboard

  [Go to **AI Gateway**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-gateway)

  1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
  2. Go to **AI** > **AI Gateway**.
  3. Select **Create Gateway**.
  4. Enter your **Gateway name**. Note: Gateway name has a 64 character limit.
  5. Select **Create**.

* API

  To set up an AI Gateway using the API:

  1. [Create an API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with the following permissions:

     * `AI Gateway - Read`
     * `AI Gateway - Edit`

  2. Get your [Account ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/).

  3. Using that API token and Account ID, send a [`POST` request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai_gateway/methods/create/) to the Cloudflare API.

## Connect Your AI Provider

1. In the AI Gateway section, select the gateway you created.
2. Select **Workers AI** as your provider to set up an endpoint specific to Workers AI. You will receive an endpoint URL for sending requests.

## Configure Your Workers AI

1. Go to **AI** > **Workers AI** in the Cloudflare dashboard.

2. Select **Use REST API** and follow the steps to create and copy the API token and Account ID.

3. **Send Requests to Workers AI**: Use the provided API endpoint. For example, you can run a model via the API using a curl command. Replace `{account_id}`, `{gateway_id}` and `{cf_api_token}` with your actual account ID and API token:

   ```bash
   curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/workers-ai/@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer {cf_api_token}' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --data '{"prompt": "What is Cloudflare?"}'
   ```

The expected output would be similar to :

```bash
{"result":{"response":"I'd be happy to explain what Cloudflare is.\n\nCloudflare is a cloud-based service that provides a range of features to help protect and improve the performance, security, and reliability of websites, applications, and other online services. Think of it as a shield for your online presence!\n\nHere are some of the key things Cloudflare does:\n\n1. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Cloudflare has a network of servers all over the world. When you visit a website that uses Cloudflare, your request is sent to the nearest server, which caches a copy of the website's content. This reduces the time it takes for the content to load, making your browsing experience faster.\n2. **DDoS Protection**: Cloudflare protects against Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. This happens when a website is overwhelmed with traffic from multiple sources to make it unavailable. Cloudflare filters out this traffic, ensuring your site remains accessible.\n3. **Firewall**: Cloudflare acts as an additional layer of security, filtering out malicious traffic and hacking attempts, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n4. **SSL Encryption**: Cloudflare offers free SSL encryption, which secure sensitive information (like passwords, credit card numbers, and browsing data) with an HTTPS connection (the \"S\" stands for Secure).\n5. **Bot Protection**: Cloudflare has an AI-driven system that identifies and blocks bots trying to exploit vulnerabilities or scrape your content.\n6. **Analytics**: Cloudflare provides insights into website traffic, helping you understand your audience and make informed decisions.\n7. **Cybersecurity**: Cloudflare offers advanced security features, such as intrusion protection, DNS filtering, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection.\n\nOverall, Cloudflare helps protect against cyber threats, improves website performance, and enhances security for online businesses, bloggers, and individuals who need to establish a strong online presence.\n\nWould you like to know more about a specific aspect of Cloudflare?"},"success":true,"errors":[],"messages":[]}%
```

## View Analytics

Monitor your AI Gateway to view usage metrics.

1. Go to **AI** > **AI Gateway** in the dashboard.
2. Select your gateway to view metrics such as request counts, token usage, caching efficiency, errors, and estimated costs. You can also turn on additional configurations like logging and rate limiting.

## Optional - Next steps

To build more with Workers, refer to [Tutorials](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tutorials/).

If you have any questions, need assistance, or would like to share your project, join the Cloudflare Developer community on [Discord](https://discord.cloudflare.com) to connect with other developers and the Cloudflare team.

title: Deploy a Worker that connects to OpenAI via AI Gateway · Cloudflare AI
  Gateway docs
description: Learn how to deploy a Worker that makes calls to OpenAI through AI Gateway
lastUpdated: 2025-11-14T10:07:26.000Z
chatbotDeprioritize: false
tags: AI,JavaScript
source_url:
  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/tutorials/deploy-aig-worker/
  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/tutorials/deploy-aig-worker/index.md
---

In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy a Worker that makes calls to OpenAI through AI Gateway. AI Gateway helps you better observe and control your AI applications with more analytics, caching, rate limiting, and logging.

This tutorial uses the most recent v4 OpenAI node library, an update released in August 2023.

## Before you start

All of the tutorials assume you have already completed the [Get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/), which gets you set up with a Cloudflare Workers account, [C3](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare), and [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).

## 1. Create an AI Gateway and OpenAI API key

On the AI Gateway page in the Cloudflare dashboard, create a new AI Gateway by clicking the plus button on the top right. You should be able to name the gateway as well as the endpoint. Click on the API Endpoints button to copy the endpoint. You can choose from provider-specific endpoints such as OpenAI, HuggingFace, and Replicate. Or you can use the universal endpoint that accepts a specific schema and supports model fallback and retries.

For this tutorial, we will be using the OpenAI provider-specific endpoint, so select OpenAI in the dropdown and copy the new endpoint.

You will also need an OpenAI account and API key for this tutorial. If you do not have one, create a new OpenAI account and create an API key to continue with this tutorial. Make sure to store your API key somewhere safe so you can use it later.

## 2. Create a new Worker

Create a Worker project in the command line:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm create cloudflare@latest -- openai-aig
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn create cloudflare openai-aig
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm create cloudflare@latest openai-aig
  ```

For setup, select the following options:

* For *What would you like to start with?*, choose `Hello World example`.
* For *Which template would you like to use?*, choose `Worker only`.
* For *Which language do you want to use?*, choose `JavaScript`.
* For *Do you want to use git for version control?*, choose `Yes`.
* For *Do you want to deploy your application?*, choose `No` (we will be making some changes before deploying).

Go to your new open Worker project:

```sh
cd openai-aig
```

Inside of your new openai-aig directory, find and open the `src/index.js` file. You will configure this file for most of the tutorial.

Initially, your generated `index.js` file should look like this:

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    return new Response("Hello World!");
  },
};
```

## 3. Configure OpenAI in your Worker

With your Worker project created, we can learn how to make your first request to OpenAI. You will use the OpenAI node library to interact with the OpenAI API. Install the OpenAI node library with `npm`:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i openai
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add openai
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add openai
  ```

In your `src/index.js` file, add the import for `openai` above `export default`:

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";
```

Within your `fetch` function, set up the configuration and instantiate your `OpenAIApi` client with the AI Gateway endpoint you created:

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const openai = new OpenAI({
      apiKey: env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
      baseURL:
        "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai", // paste your AI Gateway endpoint here
    });
  },
};
```

To make this work, you need to use [`wrangler secret put`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#secret-put) to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. This will save the API key to your environment so your Worker can access it when deployed. This key is the API key you created earlier in the OpenAI dashboard:

* npm

  ```sh
  npx wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
  ```

To make this work in local development, create a new file `.dev.vars` in your Worker project and add this line. Make sure to replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your own OpenAI API key:

```txt
OPENAI_API_KEY = "<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE>"
```

## 4. Make an OpenAI request

Now we can make a request to the OpenAI [Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api).

You can specify what model you'd like, the role and prompt, as well as the max number of tokens you want in your total request.

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const openai = new OpenAI({
      apiKey: env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
      baseURL:
        "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai",
    });


    try {
      const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4o-mini",
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What is a neuron?" }],
        max_tokens: 100,
      });


      const response = chatCompletion.choices[0].message;


      return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
    } catch (e) {
      return new Response(e);
    }
  },
};
```

## 5. Deploy your Worker application

To deploy your application, run the `npx wrangler deploy` command to deploy your Worker application:

* npm

  ```sh
  npx wrangler deploy
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn wrangler deploy
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm wrangler deploy
  ```

You can now preview your Worker at \<YOUR\_WORKER>.\<YOUR\_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev.

## 6. Review your AI Gateway

When you go to AI Gateway in your Cloudflare dashboard, you should see your recent request being logged. You can also [tweak your settings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/) to manage your logs, caching, and rate limiting settings.

Note

It is recommended to use the Dynamic Routes to implement model fallback feature

You can use the Universal Endpoint to contact every provider.

```txt
https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}
```

AI Gateway offers multiple endpoints for each Gateway you create - one endpoint per provider, and one Universal Endpoint. The Universal Endpoint requires some adjusting to your schema, but supports additional features. Some of these features are, for example, retrying a request if it fails the first time, or configuring a [fallback model/provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/fallbacks/).

You can use the Universal endpoint to contact every provider. The payload is expecting an array of message, and each message is an object with the following parameters:

* `provider` : the name of the provider you would like to direct this message to. Can be OpenAI, workers-ai, or any of our supported providers.
* `endpoint`: the pathname of the provider API you’re trying to reach. For example, on OpenAI it can be `chat/completions`, and for Workers AI this might be [`@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct/). See more in the sections that are specific to [each provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/).
* `authorization`: the content of the Authorization HTTP Header that should be used when contacting this provider. This usually starts with 'Token' or 'Bearer'.
* `query`: the payload as the provider expects it in their official API.

## cURL example

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id} \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
  {
    "provider": "workers-ai",
    "endpoint": "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer {cloudflare_token}",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "query": {
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "You are a friendly assistant"
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "provider": "openai",
    "endpoint": "chat/completions",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer {open_ai_token}",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "query": {
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "stream": true,
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]'
```

The above will send a request to Workers AI Inference API, if it fails it will proceed to OpenAI. You can add as many fallbacks as you need, just by adding another JSON in the array.

## WebSockets API beta

The Universal Endpoint can also be accessed via a [WebSockets API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/websockets-api/) which provides a single persistent connection, enabling continuous communication. This API supports all AI providers connected to AI Gateway, including those that do not natively support WebSockets.

## WebSockets example

```javascript
import WebSocket from "ws";
const ws = new WebSocket(
  "wss://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/my-account-id/my-gateway/",
  {
    headers: {
      "cf-aig-authorization": "Bearer AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN",
    },
  },
);


ws.send(
  JSON.stringify({
    type: "universal.create",
    request: {
      eventId: "my-request",
      provider: "workers-ai",
      endpoint: "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
      headers: {
        Authorization: "Bearer WORKERS_AI_TOKEN",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      query: {
        prompt: "tell me a joke",
      },
    },
  }),
);


ws.on("message", function incoming(message) {
  console.log(message.toString());
});
```

## Workers Binding example

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "ai": {
      "binding": "AI"
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [ai]
  binding = "AI"
  ```

```typescript
type Env = {
  AI: Ai;
};


export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env) {
    return env.AI.gateway("my-gateway").run({
      provider: "workers-ai",
      endpoint: "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
      headers: {
        authorization: "Bearer my-api-token",
      },
      query: {
        prompt: "tell me a joke",
      },
    });
  },
};
```

## Header configuration hierarchy

The Universal Endpoint allows you to set fallback models or providers and customize headers for each provider or request. You can configure headers at three levels:

1. **Provider level**: Headers specific to a particular provider.
2. **Request level**: Headers included in individual requests.
3. **Gateway settings**: Default headers configured in your gateway dashboard.

Since the same settings can be configured in multiple locations, AI Gateway applies a hierarchy to determine which configuration takes precedence:

* **Provider-level headers** override all other configurations.
* **Request-level headers** are used if no provider-level headers are set.
* **Gateway-level settings** are used only if no headers are configured at the provider or request levels.

This hierarchy ensures consistent behavior, prioritizing the most specific configurations. Use provider-level and request-level headers for fine-tuned control, and gateway settings for general defaults.

## Hierarchy example

This example demonstrates how headers set at different levels impact caching behavior:

* **Request-level header**: The `cf-aig-cache-ttl` is set to `3600` seconds, applying this caching duration to the request by default.
* **Provider-level header**: For the fallback provider (OpenAI), `cf-aig-cache-ttl` is explicitly set to `0` seconds, overriding the request-level header and disabling caching for responses when OpenAI is used as the provider.

This shows how provider-level headers take precedence over request-level headers, allowing for granular control of caching behavior.

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id} \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'cf-aig-cache-ttl: 3600' \
  --data '[
    {
      "provider": "workers-ai",
      "endpoint": "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {cloudflare_token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      "query": {
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a friendly assistant"
          },
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "provider": "openai",
      "endpoint": "chat/completions",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {open_ai_token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "cf-aig-cache-ttl": "0"
      },
      "query": {
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "stream": true,
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]'

---

The AI Gateway WebSockets API provides a persistent connection for AI interactions, eliminating repeated handshakes and reducing latency. This API is divided into two categories:

* **Realtime APIs** - Designed for AI providers that offer low-latency, multimodal interactions over WebSockets.
* **Non-Realtime APIs** - Supports standard WebSocket communication for AI providers, including those that do not natively support WebSockets.

## When to use WebSockets

WebSockets are long-lived TCP connections that enable bi-directional, real-time and non realtime communication between client and server. Unlike HTTP connections, which require repeated handshakes for each request, WebSockets maintain the connection, supporting continuous data exchange with reduced overhead. WebSockets are ideal for applications needing low-latency, real-time data, such as voice assistants.

## Key benefits

* **Reduced overhead**: Avoid overhead of repeated handshakes and TLS negotiations by maintaining a single, persistent connection.
* **Provider compatibility**: Works with all AI providers in AI Gateway. Even if your chosen provider does not support WebSockets, Cloudflare handles it for you, managing the requests to your preferred AI provider.

## Key differences

| Feature | Realtime APIs | Non-Realtime APIs |
| - | - | - |
| **Purpose** | Enables real-time, multimodal AI interactions for providers that offer dedicated WebSocket endpoints. | Supports WebSocket-based AI interactions with providers that do not natively support WebSockets. |
| **Use Case** | Streaming responses for voice, video, and live interactions. | Text-based queries and responses, such as LLM requests. |
| **AI Provider Support** | [Limited to providers offering real-time WebSocket APIs.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/websockets-api/realtime-api/#supported-providers) | [All AI providers in AI Gateway.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/) |
| **Streaming Support** | Providers natively support real-time data streaming. | AI Gateway handles streaming via WebSockets. |

For details on implementation, refer to the next sections:

* [Realtime WebSockets API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/websockets-api/realtime-api/)
* [Non-Realtime WebSockets API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/websockets-api/non-realtime-api/)

title: Set up Data Loss Prevention (DLP) · Cloudflare AI Gateway docs
description: Add Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to any AI Gateway to start scanning
  AI prompts and responses for sensitive data.
lastUpdated: 2025-10-22T21:11:06.000Z
chatbotDeprioritize: false
source_url:
  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/dlp/set-up-dlp/
  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/dlp/set-up-dlp/index.md
---

Add Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to any AI Gateway to start scanning AI prompts and responses for sensitive data.

## Prerequisites

* An existing [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/get-started/)

## Enable DLP for AI Gateway

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **AI** > **AI Gateway**.
3. Select a gateway where you want to enable DLP.
4. Go to the **Firewall** tab.
5. Toggle **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** to **On**.

## Add DLP policies

After enabling DLP, you can create policies to define how sensitive data should be handled:

1. Under the DLP section, click **Add Policy**.

2. Configure the following fields for each policy:

   * **Policy ID**: Enter a unique name for this policy (e.g., "Block-PII-Requests")

   * **DLP Profiles**: Select the DLP profiles to check against. AI requests/responses will be checked against each of the selected profiles. Available profiles include:

     * **Financial Information** - Credit cards, bank accounts, routing numbers
     * **Personal Identifiable Information (PII)** - Names, addresses, phone numbers
     * **Government Identifiers** - SSNs, passport numbers, driver's licenses
     * **Healthcare Information** - Medical record numbers, patient data
     * **Custom Profiles** - Organization-specific data patterns

     Note

     DLP profiles can be created and managed in the [Zero Trust DLP dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/).

   * **Action**: Choose the action to take when any of the selected profiles match:

     * **Flag** - Record the detection for audit purposes without blocking
     * **Block** - Prevent the request/response from proceeding

   * **Check**: Select what to scan:

     * **Request** - Scan user prompts sent to AI providers
     * **Response** - Scan AI model responses before returning to users
     * **Both** - Scan both requests and responses

3. Click **Save** to save your policy configuration.

## Manage DLP policies

You can create multiple DLP policies with different configurations:

* **Add multiple policies**: Click **Add Policy** to create additional policies with different profile combinations or actions
* **Enable/disable policies**: Use the toggle next to each policy to individually enable or disable them without deleting the configuration
* **Edit policies**: Click on any existing policy to modify its settings
* **Save changes**: Always click **Save** after making any changes to apply them

## Test your configuration

After configuring DLP settings:

1. Make a test AI request through your gateway that contains sample sensitive data.
2. Check the **AI Gateway Logs** to verify DLP scanning is working.
3. Review the detection results and adjust profiles or actions as needed.

## Monitor DLP events

### Viewing DLP logs in AI Gateway

DLP events are integrated into your AI Gateway logs:

1. Go to **AI** > **AI Gateway** > your gateway > **Logs**.

2. Click on any log entry to view detailed information. For requests where DLP policies were triggered, additional details are included:

   * **DLP Action Taken**: Shows whether the action was "Flag" or "Block"

   * **DLP Policies Matched**: Detailed information about each policy that matched, including:

     * Which DLP profiles triggered within each policy
     * Whether the match occurred in the request or response
     * Specific entries that matched within each DLP profile

### Filter DLP events

To view only DLP-related requests:

1. On the **Logs** tab, click **Add Filter**.

2. Select **DLP Action** from the filter options.

3. Choose to filter by:

   * **FLAG** - Show only requests where sensitive data was flagged
   * **BLOCK** - Show only requests that were blocked due to DLP policies

## Error handling

When DLP policies are triggered, your application will receive additional information through response headers and error codes.

### DLP response header

When a request matches DLP policies (whether flagged or blocked), an additional `cf-aig-dlp` header is returned containing detailed information about the match:

#### Header schema

```json
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "profile": {
        "context": {},
        "entry_ids": ["string"],
        "profile_id": "string"
      },
      "policy_ids": ["string"],
      "check": "REQUEST" | "RESPONSE"
    }
  ],
  "action": "BLOCK" | "FLAG"
}
```

#### Example header value

```json
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "profile": {
        "context": {},
        "entry_ids": [
          "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
          "f7e8d9c0-b1a2-3456-789a-bcdef0123456"
        ],
        "profile_id": "12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef"
      },
      "policy_ids": ["block_financial_data"],
      "check": "REQUEST"
    }
  ],
  "action": "BLOCK"
}
```

Use this header to programmatically detect which DLP profiles and entries were matched, which policies triggered, and whether the match occurred in the request or response.

### Error codes for blocked requests

When DLP blocks a request, your application will receive structured error responses:

* **Request blocked by DLP**

  * `"code": 2029`
  * `"message": "Request content blocked due to DLP policy violations"`

* **Response blocked by DLP**

  * `"code": 2030`
  * `"message": "Response content blocked due to DLP policy violations"`

Handle these errors in your application:

```js
try {
  const res = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {
    prompt: userInput
  }, {
    gateway: {id: 'your-gateway-id'}
  })
  return Response.json(res)
} catch (e) {
  if ((e as Error).message.includes('2029')) {
    return new Response('Request contains sensitive data and cannot be processed.')
  }
  if ((e as Error).message.includes('2030')) {
    return new Response('AI response was blocked due to sensitive content.')
  }
  return new Response('AI request failed')
}
```

## Best practices

* **Start with flagging**: Begin with "Flag" actions to understand what data is being detected before implementing blocking
* **Tune confidence levels**: Adjust detection sensitivity based on your false positive tolerance
* **Use appropriate profiles**: Select DLP profiles that match your data protection requirements
* **Monitor regularly**: Review DLP events to ensure policies are working as expected
* **Test thoroughly**: Validate DLP behavior with sample sensitive data before production deployment

## Troubleshooting

### DLP not triggering

* Verify DLP toggle is enabled for your gateway
* Ensure selected DLP profiles are appropriate for your test data
* Confirm confidence levels aren't set too high

### Unexpected blocking

* Review DLP logs to see which profiles triggered
* Consider lowering confidence levels for problematic profiles
* Test with different sample data to understand detection patterns
* Adjust profile selections if needed

For additional support with DLP configuration, refer to the [Cloudflare Data Loss Prevention documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/) or contact your Cloudflare support team.

  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/dynamic-routing/json-configuration/index.md
---

Instead of using the **dashboard editor UI** to define the route graph, you can do it using the REST API. Routes are internally represented using a simple JSON structure:

```json
{
  "id": "<route id>",
  "name": "<route name>",
  "elements": [<array of elements>]
}
```

## Supported elements

Dynamic routing supports several types of elements that you can combine to create sophisticated routing flows. Each element has specific inputs, outputs, and configuration options.

### Start Element

Marks the beginning of a route. Every route must start with a Start element.

* **Inputs**: None
* **Outputs**:
  * `next`: Forwards the unchanged request to the next element

```json
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "type": "start",
  "outputs": {
    "next": { "elementId": "<id>" }
  }
}
```

### Conditional Element (If/Else)

Evaluates a condition based on request parameters and routes the request accordingly.

* **Inputs**: Request

* **Outputs**:

  * `true`: Forwards request to provided element if condition evaluates to true
  * `false`: Forwards request to provided element if condition evaluates to false

```json
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "type": "conditional",
  "properties": {
    "condition": {
      "metadata.plan": { "$eq": "free" } // Supports MongoDB-like operators
    }
  },
  "outputs": {
    "true": { "elementId": "<id>" },
    "false": { "elementId": "<id>" }
  }
}
```

### Percentage Split

Routes requests probabilistically across multiple outputs, useful for A/B testing and gradual rollouts.

* **Inputs**: Request

* **Outputs**: Up to 5 named percentage outputs, plus an optional `else` fallback

  * Each output has a fractional probability (must total 100%)
  * `else` output handles remaining percentage if other branches don't sum to 100%

```json
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "type": "percentage",
  "outputs": {
    "10%": { "elementId": "<id>" },
    "50%": { "elementId": "<id>" },
    "else": { "elementId": "<id>" }
  }
}
```

### Rate/Budget Limit

Apply limits based on request metadata. Supports both count-based and cost-based limits.

* **Inputs**: Request

* **Outputs**:

  * `success`: Forwards request to provided element if request is not rate limited
  * `fallback`: Optional output for rate-limited requests (route terminates if not provided)

**Properties**:

* `limitType`: "count" or "cost"
* `key`: Request field to use for rate limiting (e.g. "metadata.user\_id")
* `limit`: Maximum allowed requests/cost
* `interval`: Time window in seconds
* `technique`: "sliding" or "fixed" window

```json
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "type": "rate_limit",
  "properties": {
    "limitType": "count",
    "key": "metadata.user_id",
    "limit": 100,
    "interval": 3600,
    "technique": "sliding"
  },
  "outputs": {
    "success": { "elementId": "node_model_workers_ai" },
    "fallback": { "elementId": "node_model_openai_mini" }
  }
}
```

### Model

Executes inference using a specified model and provider with configurable timeout and retry settings.

* **Inputs**: Request

* **Outputs**:

  * `success`: Forwards request to provided element if model successfully starts streaming a response
  * `fallback`: Optional output if model fails after all retries or times out

**Properties**:

* `provider`: AI provider (e.g. "openai", "anthropic")
* `model`: Specific model name
* `timeout`: Request timeout in milliseconds
* `retries`: Number of retry attempts

```json
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "type": "model",
  "properties": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "timeout": 60000,
    "retries": 4
  },
  "outputs": {
    "success": { "elementId": "<id>" },
    "fallback": { "elementId": "<id>" }
  }
}
```

### End element

Marks the end of a route. Returns the last successful model response, or an error if no model response was generated.

* **Inputs**: Request
* **Outputs**: None

```json
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "type": "end"
}
```

Warning

Ensure your gateway has [authentication](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/authentication/) turned, on and you have your upstream providers keys stored with [BYOK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/bring-your-own-keys/).

## Examples

### OpenAI SDK

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";


const cloudflareToken = "CF_AIG_TOKEN";
const accountId = "{account_id}";
const gatewayId = "{gateway_id}";
const baseURL = `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/${accountId}/${gatewayId}/compat`;


const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: cloudflareToken,
  baseURL,
});


try {
  const model = "dynamic/<your-dynamic-route-name>";
  const messages = [{ role: "user", content: "What is a neuron?" }];
  const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model,
    messages,
  });
  const response = chatCompletion.choices[0].message;
  console.log(response);
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}
```

### Fetch

```bash
curl -X POST https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/compat/chat/completions \
  --header 'cf-aig-authorization: Bearer {CF_AIG_TOKEN}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "model": "dynamic/<your-dynamic-route-name>",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Workers

```ts
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env) {
    const response = await env.AI.gateway("default").run({
      provider: "compat",
      endpoint: "chat/completion",

---

Add Guardrails to any gateway to start evaluating and potentially modifying responses.

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.

2. Go to **AI** > **AI Gateway**.

3. Select a gateway.

4. Go to **Guardrails**.

5. Switch the toggle to **On**.

6. To customize categories, select **Change** > **Configure specific categories**.

7. Update your choices for how Guardrails works on specific prompts or responses (**Flag**, **Ignore**, **Block**).

   * For **Prompts**: Guardrails will evaluate and transform incoming prompts based on your security policies.
   * For **Responses**: Guardrails will inspect the model's responses to ensure they meet your content and formatting guidelines.

8. Select **Save**.

Usage considerations

For additional details about how to implement Guardrails, refer to [Usage considerations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/guardrails/usage-considerations/).

## Viewing Guardrail results in Logs

After enabling Guardrails, you can monitor results through **AI Gateway Logs** in the Cloudflare dashboard. Guardrail logs are marked with a **green shield icon**, and each logged request includes an `eventID`, which links to its corresponding Guardrail evaluation log(s) for easy tracking. Logs are generated for all requests, including those that **pass** Guardrail checks.

## Error handling and blocked requests

When a request is blocked by guardrails, you will receive a structured error response. These indicate whether the issue occurred with the prompt or the model response. Use error codes to differentiate between prompt versus response violations.

* **Prompt blocked**

  * `"code": 2016`
  * `"message": "Prompt blocked due to security configurations"`

* **Response blocked**

  * `"code": 2017`
  * `"message": "Response blocked due to security configurations"`

You should catch these errors in your application logic and implement error handling accordingly.

For example, when using [Workers AI with a binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/integrations/aig-workers-ai-binding/):

```js
try {
  const res = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {
    prompt: "how to build a gun?"
  }, {
    gateway: {id: 'gateway_id'}
  })
  return Response.json(res)
} catch (e) {
  if ((e as Error).message.includes('2016')) {
    return new Response('Prompt was blocked by guardrails.')
  }
  if ((e as Error).message.includes('2017')) {
    return new Response('Response was blocked by guardrails.')
  }
  return new Response('Unknown AI error')
}
```

---

AI Gateway's Guardrails detects the type of AI model being used and applies safety checks accordingly:

* **Text generation models**: Both prompts and responses are evaluated.
* **Embedding models**: Only the prompt is evaluated, as the response consists of numerical embeddings, which are not meaningful for moderation.
* **Unknown models**: If the model type cannot be determined, only the prompt is evaluated, while the response bypass Guardrails.

Note

Guardrails does not yet support streaming responses. Support for streaming is planned for a future update.

---

Guardrails currently uses [Llama Guard 3 8B](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-guard-llm-based-input-output-safeguard-for-human-ai-conversations/) on [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) to perform content evaluations. The underlying model may be updated in the future, and we will reflect those changes within Guardrails.

Since Guardrails runs on Workers AI, enabling it incurs usage on Workers AI. You can monitor usage through the Workers AI Dashboard.

## Additional considerations

* **Model availability**: If at least one hazard category is set to `block`, but AI Gateway is unable to receive a response from Workers AI, the request will be blocked. Conversely, if a hazard category is set to `flag` and AI Gateway cannot obtain a response from Workers AI, the request will proceed without evaluation. This approach prioritizes availability, allowing requests to continue even when content evaluation is not possible.
* **Latency impact**: Enabling Guardrails adds some latency. Enabling Guardrails introduces additional latency to requests. Typically, evaluations using Llama Guard 3 8B on Workers AI add approximately 500 milliseconds per request. However, larger requests may experience increased latency, though this increase is not linear. Consider this when balancing safety and performance.
* **Handling long content**: When evaluating long prompts or responses, Guardrails automatically segments the content into smaller chunks, processing each through separate Guardrail requests. This approach ensures comprehensive moderation but may result in increased latency for longer inputs.
* **Supported languages**: Llama Guard 3.3 8B supports content safety classification in the following languages: English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Thai.
* **Streaming support**: Streaming is not supported when using Guardrails.

Note

Llama Guard is provided as-is without any representations, warranties, or guarantees.

AI Gateway allows you to securely export logs to an external storage location, where you can decrypt and process them. You can toggle Workers Logpush on and off in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) settings. This product is available on the Workers Paid plan. For pricing information, refer to [Pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/reference/pricing).

This guide explains how to set up Workers Logpush for AI Gateway, generate an RSA key pair for encryption, and decrypt the logs once they are received.

You can store up to 10 million logs per gateway. If your limit is reached, new logs will stop being saved and will not be exported through Workers Logpush. To continue saving and exporting logs, you must delete older logs to free up space for new logs. Workers Logpush has a limit of 4 jobs and a maximum request size of 1 MB per log.

Note

To export logs using Workers Logpush, you must have logs turned on for the gateway.

Need a higher limit?

To request an increase to a limit, complete the [Limit Increase Request Form](https://forms.gle/cuXu1QnQCrSNkkaS8). If the limit can be increased, Cloudflare will contact you with next steps.

## How logs are encrypted

We employ a hybrid encryption model efficiency and security. Initially, an AES key is generated for each log. This AES key is what actually encrypts the bulk of your data, chosen for its speed and security in handling large datasets efficiently.

Now, for securely sharing this AES key, we use RSA encryption. Here's what happens: the AES key, although lightweight, needs to be transmitted securely to the recipient. We encrypt this key with the recipient's RSA public key. This step leverages RSA's strength in secure key distribution, ensuring that only someone with the corresponding RSA private key can decrypt and use the AES key.

Once encrypted, both the AES-encrypted data and the RSA-encrypted AES key are sent together. Upon arrival, the recipient's system uses the RSA private key to decrypt the AES key. With the AES key now accessible, it is straightforward to decrypt the main data payload.

This method combines the best of both worlds: the efficiency of AES for data encryption with the secure key exchange capabilities of RSA, ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and performance are all optimally maintained throughout the data lifecycle.

## Setting up Workers Logpush

To configure Workers Logpush for AI Gateway, follow these steps:

## 1. Generate an RSA key pair locally

You need to generate a key pair to encrypt and decrypt the logs. This script will output your RSA privateKey and publicKey. Keep the private key secure, as it will be used to decrypt the logs. Below is a sample script to generate the keys using Node.js and OpenSSL.

* JavaScript

  ```js
  const crypto = require("crypto");


  const { privateKey, publicKey } = crypto.generateKeyPairSync("rsa", {
    modulusLength: 4096,
    publicKeyEncoding: {
      type: "spki",
      format: "pem",
    },
    privateKeyEncoding: {
      type: "pkcs8",
      format: "pem",
    },
  });


  console.log(publicKey);
  console.log(privateKey);
  ```

  Run the script by executing the below code on your terminal. Replace `file name` with the name of your JavaScript file.

  ```bash
  node {file name}
  ```

* OpenSSL

  1. Generate private key: Use the following command to generate a RSA private key:

     ```bash
     openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
     ```

  2. Generate public key: After generating the private key, you can extract the corresponding public key using:

     ```bash
     openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
     ```

## 2. Upload public key to gateway settings

Once you have generated the key pair, upload the public key to your AI Gateway settings. This key will be used to encrypt your logs. In order to enable Workers Logpush, you will need logs enabled for that gateway.

## 3. Set up Logpush

To set up Logpush, refer to [Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/) documentation.

## 4. Receive encrypted logs

After configuring Workers Logpush, logs will be sent encrypted using the public key you uploaded. To access the data, you will need to decrypt it using your private key. The logs will be sent to the object storage provider that you have selected.

## 5. Decrypt logs

To decrypt the encrypted log bodies and metadata from AI Gateway, you can use the following Node.js script or OpenSSL:

* JavaScript

  To decrypt the encrypted log bodies and metadata from AI Gateway, download the logs to a folder, in this case its named `my_log.log.gz`.

  Then copy this JavaScript file into the same folder and place your private key in the top variable.

  ```js
  const privateKeyStr = `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  ....
  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`;


  const crypto = require("crypto");
  const privateKey = crypto.createPrivateKey(privateKeyStr);


  const fs = require("fs");
  const zlib = require("zlib");
  const readline = require("readline");


  async function importAESGCMKey(keyBuffer) {
    try {
      // Ensure the key length is valid for AES
      if ([128, 192, 256].includes(256)) {
        return await crypto.webcrypto.subtle.importKey(
          "raw",
          keyBuffer,
          {
            name: "AES-GCM",
            length: 256,
          },
          true, // Whether the key is extractable (true in this case to allow for export later if needed)
          ["encrypt", "decrypt"], // Use for encryption and decryption
        );
      } else {
        throw new Error("Invalid AES key length. Must be 128, 12, or 256 bits.");
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to import key:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  }


  async function decryptData(encryptedData, aesKey, iv) {
    const decryptedData = await crypto.subtle.decrypt(
      { name: "AES-GCM", iv: iv },
      aesKey,
      encryptedData,
    );
    return new TextDecoder().decode(decryptedData);
  }


  async function decryptBase64(privateKey, data) {
    if (data.key === undefined) {
      return data;
    }


    const aesKeyBuf = crypto.privateDecrypt(
      {
        key: privateKey,
        oaepHash: "SHA256",
      },
      Buffer.from(data.key, "base64"),
    );
    const aesKey = await importAESGCMKey(aesKeyBuf);


    const decryptedData = await decryptData(
      Buffer.from(data.data, "base64"),
      aesKey,
      Buffer.from(data.iv, "base64"),
    );


    return decryptedData.toString();
  }


  async function run() {
    let lineReader = readline.createInterface({
      input: fs.createReadStream("my_log.log.gz").pipe(zlib.createGunzip()),
    });


    lineReader.on("line", async (line) => {
      line = JSON.parse(line);


      const { Metadata, RequestBody, ResponseBody, ...remaining } = line;


      console.log({
        ...remaining,
        Metadata: await decryptBase64(privateKey, Metadata),
        RequestBody: await decryptBase64(privateKey, RequestBody),
        ResponseBody: await decryptBase64(privateKey, ResponseBody),
      });
      console.log("--");
    });
  }


  run();
  ```

  Run the script by executing the below code on your terminal. Replace `file name` with the name of your JavaScript file.

  ```bash
  node {file name}
  ```

  The script reads the encrypted log file `(my_log.log.gz)`, decrypts the metadata, request body, and response body, and prints the decrypted data. Ensure you replace the `privateKey` variable with your actual private RSA key that you generated in step 1.

* OpenSSL

  1. Decrypt the encrypted log file using the private key.

  Assuming that the logs were encrypted with the public key (for example `public_key.pem`), you can use the private key (`private_key.pem`) to decrypt the log file.

  For example, if the encrypted logs are in a file named `encrypted_logs.bin`, you can decrypt it like this:

  ```bash
  openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private_key.pem -in encrypted_logs.bin -out decrypted_logs.txt
  ```

  * `-decrypt` tells OpenSSL that we want to decrypt the file.
  * `-inkey private_key.pem` specifies the private key that will be used to decrypt the logs.
  * `-in encrypted_logs.bin` is the encrypted log file.
  * `-out decrypted_logs.txt`decrypted logs will be saved into this file.

  1. View the decrypted logs Once decrypted, you can view the logs by simply running:

  ```bash
  cat decrypted_logs.txt
  ```

  This command will output the decrypted logs to the terminal.

[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) allows you to build and scale generative AI applications with foundation models.

## Endpoint

```txt
https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/aws-bedrock`
```

## Prerequisites

When making requests to Amazon Bedrock, ensure you have the following:

* Your AI Gateway Account ID.
* Your AI Gateway gateway name.
* An active Amazon Bedrock API token.
* The name of the Amazon Bedrock model you want to use.

## Make a request

When making requests to Amazon Bedrock, replace `https://bedrock-runtime.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/` in the URL you're currently using with `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/aws-bedrock/bedrock-runtime/us-east-1/`, then add the model you want to run at the end of the URL.

With Bedrock, you will need to sign the URL before you make requests to AI Gateway. You can try using the [`aws4fetch`](https://github.com/mhart/aws4fetch) SDK.

## Examples

### Use `aws4fetch` SDK with TypeScript

```typescript
import { AwsClient } from "aws4fetch";


interface Env {
  accessKey: string;
  secretAccessKey: string;
}


export default {
  async fetch(
    request: Request,
    env: Env,
    ctx: ExecutionContext,
  ): Promise<Response> {
    // replace with your configuration
    const cfAccountId = "{account_id}";
    const gatewayName = "{gateway_id}";
    const region = "us-east-1";


    // added as secrets (https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/)
    const accessKey = env.accessKey;
    const secretKey = env.secretAccessKey;


    const awsClient = new AwsClient({
      accessKeyId: accessKey,
      secretAccessKey: secretKey,
      region: region,
      service: "bedrock",
    });


    const requestBodyString = JSON.stringify({
      inputText: "What does ethereal mean?",
    });


    const stockUrl = new URL(
      `https://bedrock-runtime.${region}.amazonaws.com/model/amazon.titan-embed-text-v1/invoke`,
    );


    const headers = {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    };


    // sign the original request
    const presignedRequest = await awsClient.sign(stockUrl.toString(), {
      method: "POST",
      headers: headers,
      body: requestBodyString,
    });


    // Gateway Url
    const gatewayUrl = new URL(
      `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/${cfAccountId}/${gatewayName}/aws-bedrock/bedrock-runtime/${region}/model/amazon.titan-embed-text-v1/invoke`,
    );


    // make the request through the gateway url
    const response = await fetch(gatewayUrl, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: presignedRequest.headers,
      body: requestBodyString,
    });


    if (
      response.ok &&
      response.headers.get("content-type")?.includes("application/json")
    ) {
      const data = await response.json();
      return new Response(JSON.stringify(data));
    }


    return new Response("Invalid response", { status: 500 });
  },
};

[Fal AI](https://fal.ai/) provides access to 600+ production-ready generative media models through a single, unified API. The service offers the world's largest collection of open image, video, voice, and audio generation models, all accessible with one line of code.

## Endpoint

```txt
https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/fal
```

## URL structure

When making requests to Fal AI, replace `https://fal.run` in the URL you're currently using with `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/fal`.

## Prerequisites

When making requests to Fal AI, ensure you have the following:

* Your AI Gateway Account ID.
* Your AI Gateway gateway name.
* An active Fal AI API token.
* The name of the Fal AI model you want to use.

## Default synchronous API

By default, requests to the Fal AI endpoint will hit the synchronous API at `https://fal.run/<path>`.

### cURL example

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/fal/fal-ai/fast-sdxl \
  --header 'Authorization: Key {fal_ai_token}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "prompt": "Make an image of a cat flying an aeroplane"
  }'
```

## Custom target URLs

If you need to hit a different target URL, you can supply the entire Fal target URL in the `x-fal-target-url` header.

### cURL example with custom target URL

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/fal \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {fal_ai_token}' \
  --header 'x-fal-target-url: https://queue.fal.run/fal-ai/bytedance/seedream/v4/edit' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "prompt": "Dress the model in the clothes and hat. Add a cat to the scene and change the background to a Victorian era building.",
    "image_urls": [
      "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_inputs/seedream4_edit_input_1.png",
      "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_inputs/seedream4_edit_input_2.png",
      "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_inputs/seedream4_edit_input_3.png",
      "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_inputs/seedream4_edit_input_4.png"
    ]
  }'
```

## WebSocket API

Fal AI also supports real-time interactions through WebSockets. For WebSocket connections and examples, see the [Realtime WebSockets API documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/websockets-api/realtime-api/#fal-ai).

## JavaScript SDK integration

The `x-fal-target-url` format is compliant with the Fal SDKs, so AI Gateway can be easily passed as a `proxyUrl` in the SDKs.

### JavaScript SDK example

```js
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";


fal.config({
  credentials: "{fal_ai_token}", // OR pass a cloudflare api token if using BYOK on AI Gateway
  proxyUrl: "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/fal"
});


const result = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/bytedance/seedream/v4/edit", {
  "input": {
    "prompt": "Dress the model in the clothes and hat. Add a cat to the scene and change the background to a Victorian era building.",
    "image_urls": [
      "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_inputs/seedream4_edit_input_1.png",
      "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_inputs/seedream4_edit_input_2.png",
      "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_inputs/seedream4_edit_input_3.png",
      "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_inputs/seedream4_edit_input_4.png"

[Parallel](https://parallel.ai/) is a web API purpose-built for AIs, providing production-ready outputs with minimal hallucination and evidence-based results.

## Endpoint

```txt
https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/parallel
```

## URL structure

When making requests to Parallel, you can route to any Parallel endpoint through AI Gateway by appending the path after `parallel`. For example, to access the Tasks API at `/v1/tasks/runs`, use:

```txt
https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/parallel/v1/tasks/runs
```

## Prerequisites

When making requests to Parallel, ensure you have the following:

* Your AI Gateway Account ID.
* Your AI Gateway gateway name.
* An active Parallel API key.

## Examples

### Tasks API

The [Tasks API](https://docs.parallel.ai/task-api/task-quickstart) allows you to create comprehensive research and analysis tasks.

    ],
    "processor": "base",
    "max_results": 10,
    "max_chars_per_result": 6000
  }'
```

## Chat API

The [Chat API](https://docs.parallel.ai/chat-api/chat-quickstart) is supported through AI Gateway's Unified Chat Completions API. See below for more details:

## OpenAI-Compatible Endpoint

You can also use the [OpenAI-compatible endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/chat-completion/) (`/ai-gateway/usage/chat-completion/`) to access Parallel models using the OpenAI API schema. To do so, send your requests to:

```txt
https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/compat/chat/completions
```

Specify:

```json
{
"model": "parallel/{model}"
}
```

#### JavaScript SDK example

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";


const apiKey = "{parallel_api_key}";
const accountId = "{account_id}";
const gatewayId = "{gateway_id}";
const baseURL = `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/${accountId}/${gatewayId}/compat`;


const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey,
  baseURL,
});


try {
  const model = "parallel/speed";
  const messages = [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }];
  const chatCompletion = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model,
    messages,
  });
  const response = chatCompletion.choices[0].message;
  console.log(response);
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}
```

### FindAll API

The [FindAll API](https://docs.parallel.ai/findall-api/findall-quickstart) enables structured data extraction from complex queries.

#### cURL example

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/parallel/v1beta/findall/ingest \
  --header 'x-api-key: {parallel_api_key}' \

title: Google Vertex AI · Cloudflare AI Gateway docs
description: Google Vertex AI enables developers to easily build and deploy
  enterprise ready generative AI experiences.
lastUpdated: 2025-11-24T18:38:12.000Z
chatbotDeprioritize: false
source_url:

  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/vertex/index.md
---

[Google Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) enables developers to easily build and deploy enterprise ready generative AI experiences.

Below is a quick guide on how to set your Google Cloud Account:

1. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account

   * Sign up for a [GCP account](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). New users may be eligible for credits (valid for 90 days).

2. Enable the Vertex AI API

   * Navigate to [Enable Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/aiplatform.googleapis.com) and activate the API for your project.

3. Apply for access to desired models.

## Endpoint

```txt
https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/google-vertex-ai
```

## Prerequisites

When making requests to Google Vertex, you will need:

* AI Gateway account tag
* AI Gateway gateway name
* Google Vertex API key
* Google Vertex Project Name
* Google Vertex Region (for example, us-east4)
* Google Vertex model

## URL structure

Your new base URL will use the data above in this structure: `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/google-vertex-ai/v1/projects/{project_name}/locations/{region}`.

Then you can append the endpoint you want to hit, for example: `/publishers/google/models/{model}:{generative_ai_rest_resource}`

So your final URL will come together as: `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/google-vertex-ai/v1/projects/{project_name}/locations/{region}/publishers/google/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent`

## Authenticating with Vertex AI

Authenticating with Vertex AI normally requires generating short-term credentials using the [Google Cloud SDKs](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/authentication) with a complicated setup, but AI Gateway simplifies this for you with multiple options:

### Option 1: Service Account JSON

AI Gateway supports passing a Google service account JSON directly in the `Authorization` header on requests or through AI Gateway's [Bring Your Own Keys](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/bring-your-own-keys/) feature.

You can [create a service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) in the Google Cloud Console. Ensure that the service account has the required permissions for the Vertex AI endpoints and models you plan to use.

AI Gateway uses your service account JSON to generate short-term access tokens which are cached and used for consecutive requests, and are automatically refreshed when they expire.

Note

The service account JSON must include an additional key called `region` with the GCP region code (for example, `us-east1`) you intend to use for your [Vertex AI endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest#service-endpoint). You can also pass the region code `global` to use the global endpoint.

#### Example service account JSON structure

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "your-private-key-id",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/your-service-account%40your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "region": "us-east1"
}
```

You can pass this JSON in the `Authorization` header or configure it in [Bring Your Own Keys](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/bring-your-own-keys/).

### Option 2: Direct Access Token

If you are already using the Google Cloud SDKs and generating a short-term access token (for example, with `gcloud auth print-access-token`), you can directly pass this as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header of the request.

Note

This option is only supported for the provider-specific endpoint, not for the unified chat completions endpoint.

```bash
curl "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/google-vertex-ai/v1/projects/{project_name}/locations/{region}/publishers/google/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ya29.c.b0Aaekm1K..." \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "contents": {
          "role": "user",
          "parts": [
            {
              "text": "Tell me more about Cloudflare"
            }
          ]
        }
      }'
```

## Using Unified Chat Completions API

AI Gateway provides a [Unified API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/chat-completion/) that works across providers. For Google Vertex AI, you can use the standard chat completions format. Note that the model field includes the provider prefix, so your model string will look like `google-vertex-ai/google/gemini-2.5-pro`.

### Endpoint

```txt
https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/compat/chat/completions
```

### Example with OpenAI SDK

```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai';


const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: '{service_account_json}',
  baseURL: 'https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/compat'
});


const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'google-vertex-ai/google/gemini-2.5-pro',
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'What is Cloudflare?'
    }
  ]
});


console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```

### Example with cURL

```bash
curl "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/compat/chat/completions" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {service_account_json}" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "model": "google-vertex-ai/google/gemini-2.5-pro",
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
          }
        ]
      }'
```

Note

See the [Authenticating with Vertex AI](#authenticating-with-vertex-ai) section below for details on the service account JSON structure and authentication options.

## Using Provider-Specific Endpoint

You can also use the provider-specific endpoint to access the full Vertex AI API.

### cURL

```bash
curl "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/google-vertex-ai/v1/projects/{project_name}/locations/{region}/publishers/google/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {vertex_api_key}" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "contents": {
          "role": "user",
          "parts": [
            {
              "text": "Tell me more about Cloudflare"
            }
          ]
        }'
```

Use AI Gateway for analytics, caching, and security on requests to [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/). Workers AI integrates seamlessly with AI Gateway, allowing you to execute AI inference via API requests or through an environment binding for Workers scripts. The binding simplifies the process by routing requests through your AI Gateway with minimal setup.

## Prerequisites

When making requests to Workers AI, ensure you have the following:

* Your AI Gateway Account ID.
* Your AI Gateway gateway name.
* An active Workers AI API token.
* The name of the Workers AI model you want to use.

## REST API

To interact with a REST API, update the URL used for your request:

* **Previous**:

```txt
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai/run/{model_id}
```

* **New**:

```txt
https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/workers-ai/{model_id}
```

For these parameters:

* `{account_id}` is your Cloudflare [account ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/rest-api/#1-get-api-token-and-account-id).
* `{gateway_id}` refers to the name of your existing [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/get-started/#create-gateway).
* `{model_id}` refers to the model ID of the [Workers AI model](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/).

## Examples

First, generate an [API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with `Workers AI Read` access and use it in your request.

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/workers-ai/@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
 --header 'Authorization: Bearer {cf_api_token}' \
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data '{"prompt": "What is Cloudflare?"}'
```

```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/workers-ai/@cf/huggingface/distilbert-sst-2-int8 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {cf_api_token}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{ "text": "Cloudflare docs are amazing!" }'
```

### OpenAI compatible endpoints

Workers AI supports OpenAI compatible endpoints for [text generation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) (`/v1/chat/completions`) and [text embedding models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) (`/v1/embeddings`). This allows you to use the same code as you would for your OpenAI commands, but swap in Workers AI easily.



```bash
curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/workers-ai/v1/chat/completions \
 --header 'Authorization: Bearer {cf_api_token}' \
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data '{
      "model": "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
        }
      ]
    }
'
```

## Workers Binding

You can integrate Workers AI with AI Gateway using an environment binding. To include an AI Gateway within your Worker, add the gateway as an object in your Workers AI request.

* JavaScript

  ```js
  export default {
    async fetch(request, env) {
      const response = await env.AI.run(
        "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
        {
          prompt: "Why should you use Cloudflare for your AI inference?",
        },
        {
          gateway: {
            id: "{gateway_id}",
            skipCache: false,
            cacheTtl: 3360,
          },
        },
      );
      return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
    },
  };
  ```

* TypeScript

  ```ts
  export interface Env {
    AI: Ai;
  }


  export default {
    async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
      const response = await env.AI.run(
        "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
        {
          prompt: "Why should you use Cloudflare for your AI inference?",
        },
        {
          gateway: {
            id: "{gateway_id}",
            skipCache: false,
            cacheTtl: 3360,
          },
        },
      );
      return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
    },
  } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
  ```

For a detailed step-by-step guide on integrating Workers AI with AI Gateway using a binding, see [Integrations in AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/integrations/aig-workers-ai-binding/).

Workers AI supports the following parameters for AI gateways:

* `id` string
  * Name of your existing [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/get-started/#create-gateway). Must be in the same account as your Worker.
* `skipCache` boolean(default: false)
  * Controls whether the request should [skip the cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching/#skip-cache-cf-aig-skip-cache).
* `cacheTtl` number
  * Controls the [Cache TTL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching/#cache-ttl-cf-aig-cache-ttl).

## OpenAI-Compatible Endpoint

You can also use the [OpenAI-compatible endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/chat-completion/) (`/ai-gateway/usage/chat-completion/`) to access Workers AI models using the OpenAI API schema. To do so, send your requests to:

```txt
https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/compat/chat/completions
```

Specify:

```json
{
"model": "workers-ai/{model}"
}
```

title: Non-realtime WebSockets API · Cloudflare AI Gateway docs
description: The Non-realtime WebSockets API allows you to establish persistent
  connections for AI requests without requiring repeated handshakes. This
  approach is ideal for applications that do not require real-time interactions

---

The Non-realtime WebSockets API allows you to establish persistent connections for AI requests without requiring repeated handshakes. This approach is ideal for applications that do not require real-time interactions but still benefit from reduced latency and continuous communication.

## Set up WebSockets API

1. Generate an AI Gateway token with appropriate AI Gateway Run and opt in to using an authenticated gateway.

2. Modify your Universal Endpoint URL by replacing `https://` with `wss://` to initiate a WebSocket connection:

   ```plaintext
   wss://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}
   ```

3. Open a WebSocket connection authenticated with a Cloudflare token with the AI Gateway Run permission.

Note

Alternatively, we also support authentication via the `sec-websocket-protocol` header if you are using a browser WebSocket.

## Example request

```javascript
import WebSocket from "ws";


const ws = new WebSocket(
  "wss://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/my-account-id/my-gateway/",
  {
    headers: {
      "cf-aig-authorization": "Bearer AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN",
    },
  },
);


ws.on("open", () => {
  ws.send(
    JSON.stringify({
      type: "universal.create",
      request: {
        eventId: "my-request",
        provider: "workers-ai",
        endpoint: "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
        headers: {
          Authorization: "Bearer WORKERS_AI_TOKEN",
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        query: {
          prompt: "tell me a joke",
        },
      },
    }),
  );
})


ws.on("message", (message) => {
  console.log(message.toString());
});
```

## Example response

```json
{
  "type": "universal.created",
  "metadata": {
    "cacheStatus": "MISS",
    "eventId": "my-request",
    "logId": "01JC3R94FRD97JBCBX3S0ZAXKW",
    "step": "0",
    "contentType": "application/json"
  },
  "response": {
    "result": {
      "response": "Why was the math book sad? Because it had too many problems. Would you like to hear another one?"
    },
    "success": true,
    "errors": [],
    "messages": []
  }
}
```

## Example streaming request

For streaming requests, AI Gateway sends an initial message with request metadata indicating the stream is starting:

```json
{
  "type": "universal.created",
  "metadata": {
    "cacheStatus": "MISS",
    "eventId": "my-request",
    "logId": "01JC40RB3NGBE5XFRZGBN07572",
    "step": "0",
    "contentType": "text/event-stream"
  }
}
```

After this initial message, all streaming chunks are relayed in real-time to the WebSocket connection as they arrive from the inference provider. Only the `eventId` field is included in the metadata for these streaming chunks. The `eventId` allows AI Gateway to include a client-defined ID with each message, even in a streaming WebSocket environment.

```json
{
  "type": "universal.stream",
  "metadata": {
    "eventId": "my-request"
  },
  "response": {
    "response": "would"
  }
}
```

Once all chunks for a request have been streamed, AI Gateway sends a final message to signal the completion of the request. For added flexibility, this message includes all the metadata again, even though it was initially provided at the start of the streaming process.

```json
{
  "type": "universal.done",
  "metadata": {
    "cacheStatus": "MISS",
    "eventId": "my-request",
    "logId": "01JC40RB3NGBE5XFRZGBN07572",
    "step": "0",
    "contentType": "text/event-stream"
  }
}
```

Some AI providers support real-time, low-latency interactions over WebSockets. AI Gateway allows seamless integration with these APIs, supporting multimodal interactions such as text, audio, and video.

## Supported Providers

* [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-websocket)
* [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/multimodal-live)
* [Cartesia](https://docs.cartesia.ai/api-reference/tts/tts)
* [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/api-reference/conversational-ai/websocket)
* [Fal AI](https://docs.fal.ai/model-apis/model-endpoints/websockets)
* [Deepgram (Workers AI)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/?authors=deepgram)

## Authentication

For real-time WebSockets, authentication can be done using:

* Headers (for non-browser environments)
* `sec-websocket-protocol` (for browsers)

Note

Provider specific API Keys can also be alternatively configured on AI Gateway using our [BYOK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/bring-your-own-keys) feature. You must still include the `cf-aig-authorization` header in the websocket request.

## Examples

```javascript
import WebSocket from "ws";


const url =
  "wss://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/<account_id>/<gateway>/openai?model=gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17";
const ws = new WebSocket(url, {
  headers: {
    "cf-aig-authorization": process.env.CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY,
    Authorization: "Bearer " + process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    "OpenAI-Beta": "realtime=v1",
  },
});


ws.on("open", () => console.log("Connected to server."));
ws.on("message", (message) => console.log(JSON.parse(message.toString())));

  }),
);
```

For more information on Fal AI's WebSocket API, see their [HTTP over WebSocket documentation](https://docs.fal.ai/model-apis/model-endpoints/websockets).

### Deepgram (Workers AI)

Workers AI provides Deepgram models for real-time speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities through WebSocket connections.

#### Speech-to-Text (STT)

Workers AI supports two Deepgram STT models: `@cf/deepgram/nova-3` and `@cf/deepgram/flux`. The following example demonstrates real-time audio transcription from a microphone:

```javascript
import WebSocket from "ws";
import mic from "mic";


const ws = new WebSocket(
  "wss://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/<account_id>/<gateway>/workers-ai?model=@cf/deepgram/nova-3&encoding=linear16&sample_rate=16000&interim_results=true",
  {
    headers: {
      "cf-aig-authorization": process.env.CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY,
    },
  },
);


// Configure microphone
const micInstance = mic({
  rate: "16000",
  channels: "1",
  debug: false,
  exitOnSilence: 6,
});


const micInputStream = micInstance.getAudioStream();


micInputStream.on("data", (data) => {
  if (ws.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
    ws.send(data);
  }
});


micInputStream.on("error", (error) => {
  console.error("Microphone error:", error);
});


ws.onopen = () => {
  console.log("Connected to WebSocket");
  console.log("Starting microphone...");
  micInstance.start();
};


ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  try {
    const parse = JSON.parse(event.data);
    if (parse.channel?.alternatives?.[0]?.transcript) {
      if (parse.is_final) {
        console.log(
          "Final transcript:",
          parse.channel.alternatives[0].transcript,
        );
      } else {
        console.log(
          "Interim transcript:",
          parse.channel.alternatives[0].transcript,
        );
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error parsing message:", error);
  }
};


ws.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error("WebSocket error:", error);
};


ws.onclose = () => {
  console.log("WebSocket closed");
  micInstance.stop();
};
```

#### Text-to-Speech (TTS)

Workers AI supports the Deepgram `@cf/deepgram/aura-1` model for TTS. The following example demonstrates converting text input to audio:

```javascript
import WebSocket from "ws";
import readline from "readline";
import Speaker from "speaker";


const ws = new WebSocket(
  "wss://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/<account_id>/<gateway>/workers-ai?model=@cf/deepgram/aura-1",
  {
    headers: {
      "cf-aig-authorization": process.env.CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY,
    },
  },
);


// Speaker management
let currentSpeaker = null;
let isPlayingAudio = false;


// Setup readline for text input
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
  prompt: "Enter text to speak (or \"quit\" to exit): ",
});


ws.onopen = () => {
  console.log("Connected to Deepgram TTS WebSocket");
  rl.prompt();
};


ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  // Check if message is JSON (metadata, flushed, etc.) or raw audio
  if (event.data instanceof Buffer || event.data instanceof ArrayBuffer) {
    // Raw audio data - create new speaker if needed
    if (!currentSpeaker) {
      currentSpeaker = new Speaker({
        channels: 1,
        bitDepth: 16,
        sampleRate: 24000,
      });
      isPlayingAudio = true;
    }
    currentSpeaker.write(Buffer.from(event.data));
  } else {
    try {
      const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
      switch (message.type) {
        case "Metadata":
          console.log("Model info:", message.model_name, message.model_version);
          break;
        case "Flushed":
          console.log("Audio complete");
          // End speaker after flush to prevent buffer underflow
          if (currentSpeaker && isPlayingAudio) {
            currentSpeaker.end();
            currentSpeaker = null;
            isPlayingAudio = false;
          }
          rl.prompt();
          break;
        case "Cleared":
          console.log("Audio cleared, sequence:", message.sequence_id);
          break;
        case "Warning":
          console.warn("Warning:", message.description);
          break;
      }
    } catch (error) {
      // Not JSON, might be raw audio as string
      if (!currentSpeaker) {
        currentSpeaker = new Speaker({
          channels: 1,
          bitDepth: 16,
          sampleRate: 24000,
        });
        isPlayingAudio = true;
      }
      currentSpeaker.write(Buffer.from(event.data));
    }
  }
};


ws.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error("WebSocket error:", error);
};


ws.onclose = () => {
  console.log("WebSocket closed");
  if (currentSpeaker) {
    currentSpeaker.end();
  }
  rl.close();
  process.exit(0);
};


// Handle user input
rl.on("line", (input) => {
  const text = input.trim();


  if (text.toLowerCase() === "quit") {
    // Send Close message
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "Close" }));
    ws.close();
    return;
  }


  if (text.length > 0) {
    // Send text to TTS
    ws.send(
      JSON.stringify({
        type: "Speak",
        text: text,
      }),
    );


    // Flush to get audio immediately
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "Flush" }));
    console.log("Flushing audio");
  }


  rl.prompt();
});


rl.on("close", () => {
  if (ws.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
    ws.close();
  }
});
```
